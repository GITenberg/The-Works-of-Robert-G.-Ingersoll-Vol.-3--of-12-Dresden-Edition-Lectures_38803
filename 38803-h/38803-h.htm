    <h2>
      SHAKESPEARE
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE was the greatest genius of our world. He left to us
      the richest legacy of all the dead&mdash;the treasures of the rarest soul
      that ever lived and loved and wrought of words the statues, pictures,
      robes and gems of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is hard to overstate the debt we owe to the men and women of genius.
      Take from our world what they have given, and all the niches would be
      empty, all the walls naked&mdash;meaning and connection would fall from
      words of poetry and fiction, music would go back to common air, and all
      the forms of subtle and enchanting Art would lose proportion and become
      the unmeaning waste and shattered spoil of thoughtless Chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare is too great a theme. I feel as though endeavoring to grasp a
      globe so large that the hand obtains no hold. He who would worthily speak
      of the great dramatist should be inspired by "a muse of fire that should
      ascend the brightest heaven of invention"&mdash;he should have "a kingdom
      for a stage, and monarchs to behold the swelling scene."
    </p>
    <p>
      More than three centuries ago, the most intellectual of the human race was
      born. He was not of supernatural origin. At his birth there were no
      celestial pyrotechnics. His father and mother were both English, and both
      had the cheerful habit of living in this world. The cradle in which he was
      rocked was canopied by neither myth nor miracle, and in his veins there
      was no drop of royal blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      This babe became the wonder of mankind. Neither of his parents could read
      or write. He grew up in a small and ignorant village on the banks of the
      Avon, in the midst of the common people of three hundred years ago. There
      was nothing in the peaceful, quiet landscape on which he looked, nothing
      in the low hills, the cultivated and undulating fields, and nothing in the
      murmuring stream, to excite the imagination&mdash;nothing, so far as we
      can see, calculated to sow the seeds of the subtlest and sublimest
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there is nothing connected with his education, or his lack of
      education, that in any way accounts for what he did. It is supposed that
      he attended school in his native town&mdash;but of this we are not
      certain. Many have tried to show that he was, after all, of gentle blood,
      but the fact seems to be the other way. Some of his biographers have
      sought to do him honor by showing that he was patronized by Queen
      Elizabeth, but of this there is not the slightest proof.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, there never sat on any throne a king, queen, or
      emperor who could have honored William Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ignorant people are apt to overrate the value of what is called education.
      The sons of the poor, having suffered the privations of poverty, think of
      wealth as the mother of joy. On the other hand, the children of the rich,
      finding that gold does not produce happiness, are apt to underrate the
      value of wealth. So the children of the educated often care but little for
      books, and hold all culture in contempt. The children of great authors do
      not, as a rule, become writers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature is filled with tendencies and obstructions. Extremes beget
      limitations, even as a river by its own swiftness creates obstructions for
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Possibly, many generations of culture breed a desire for the rude joys of
      savagery, and possibly generations of ignorance breed such a longing for
      knowledge, that of this desire, of this hunger of the brain, Genius is
      born. It may be that the mind, by lying fallow, by remaining idle for
      generations, gathers strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's father seems to have been an ordinary man of his time and
      class. About the only thing we know of him is that he was officially
      reported for not coming monthly to church. This is good as far as it goes.
      We can hardly blame him, because at that time Richard Bifield was the
      minister at Stratford, and an extreme Puritan, one who read the Psalter by
      Sternhold and Hopkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church was at one time Catholic, but in John Shakespeare's day it was
      Puritan, and in 1564, the year of Shakespeare's birth, they had the images
      defaced. It is greatly to the honor of John Shakespeare that he refused to
      listen to the "tidings of great joy" as delivered by the Puritan Bifield.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is known of his mother, except her beautiful name&mdash;Mary
      Arden. In those days but little attention was given to the biographies of
      women. They were born, married, had children, and died. No matter how
      celebrated their sons became, the mothers were forgotten. In old times,
      when a man achieved distinction, great pains were taken to find out about
      the father and grandfather&mdash;the idea being that genius is inherited
      from the father's side. The truth is, that all great men have had great
      mothers. Great women have had, as a rule, great fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother of Shakespeare was, without doubt, one of the greatest of
      women. She dowered her son with passion and imagination and the higher
      qualities of the soul, beyond all other men. It has been said that a man
      of genius should select his ancestors with great care&mdash;and yet there
      does not seem to be as much in heredity as most people think. The children
      of the great are often small. Pigmies are born in palaces, while over the
      children of genius is the roof of straw. Most of the great are like
      mountains, with the valley of ancestors on one side and the depression of
      posterity on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his day Shakespeare was of no particular importance. It may be that his
      mother had some marvelous and prophetic dreams, but Stratford was
      unconscious of the immortal child. He was never engaged in a reputable
      business. Socially he occupied a position below servants. The law
      described him as "a sturdy vagabond." He was neither a noble, a soldier,
      nor a priest. Among the half-civilized people of England, he who amused
      and instructed them was regarded as a menial. Kings had their clowns, the
      people their actors and musicians. Shakespeare was scheduled as a servant.
      It is thus that successful stupidity has always treated genius. Mozart was
      patronized by an Archbishop&mdash;lived in the palace,&mdash;but was
      compelled to eat with the scullions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The composer of divine melodies was not fit to sit by the side of the
      theologian, who long ago would have been forgotten but for the fame of the
      composer.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know but little of the personal peculiarities, of the daily life, or of
      what may be called the outward Shakespeare, and it may be fortunate that
      so little is known. He might have been belittled by friendly fools. What
      silly stories, what idiotic personal reminiscences, would have been
      remembered by those who scarcely saw him! We have his best&mdash;his
      sublimest&mdash;and we have probably lost only the trivial and the
      worthless. All that is known can be written on a page.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are tolerably certain of the date of his birth, of his marriage and of
      his death. We think he went to London in 1586, when he was twenty-two
      years old. We think that three years afterward he was part owner of
      Blackfriars' Theatre. We have a few signatures, some of which are supposed
      to be genuine. We know that he bought some land&mdash;that he had two or
      three law-suits. We know the names of his children. We also know that this
      incomparable man&mdash;so apart from, and so familiar with, all the world&mdash;lived
      during his literary life in London&mdash;that he was an actor, dramatist
      and manager&mdash;that he returned to Stratford, the place of his birth,&mdash;that
      he gave his writings to negligence, deserted the children of his brain&mdash;that
      he died on the anniversary of his birth at the age of fifty-two, and that
      he was buried in the church where the images had been defaced, and that on
      his tomb was chiseled a rude, absurd and ignorant epitaph.
    </p>
    <p>
      No letter of his to any human being has been found, and no line written by
      him can be shown.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here let me give my explanation of the epitaph. Shakespeare was an
      actor&mdash;a disreputable business&mdash;but he made money&mdash;always
      reputable. He came back from London a rich man. He bought land, and built
      houses. Some of the supposed great probably treated him with deference.
      When he died he was buried in the church. Then came a reaction. The pious
      thought the church had been profaned. They did not feel that the ashes of
      an actor were fit to lie in holy ground. The people began to say the body
      ought to be removed. Then it was, as I believe, that Dr. John Hall,
      Shakespeare's son-in-law, had this epitaph cut on the tomb:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Good friend, for Jesus' sake forbeare
     To digg the dust enclosed heare:
     Blest be ye man yt spares thes stones,
     And curst be he yt moves my bones."
</pre>
    <p>
      Certainly Shakespeare could have had no fear that his tomb would be
      violated. How could it have entered his mind to have put a warning, a
      threat and a blessing, upon his grave? But the ignorant people of that day
      were no doubt convinced that the epitaph was the voice of the dead, and so
      feeling they feared to invade the tomb. In this way the dust was left in
      peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      This epitaph gave me great trouble for years. It puzzled me to explain why
      he, who erected the intellectual pyramids,&mdash;great ranges of mountains&mdash;should
      put such a pebble at his tomb. But when I stood beside the grave and read
      the ignorant words, the explanation I have given flashed upon me.
    </p>
    <p>
      II.
    </p>
    <p>
      IT has been said that Shakespeare was hardly mentioned by his
      contemporaries, and that he was substantially unknown. This is a mistake.
      In 1600 a book was published called <i>England's Parnassus</i>, and it
      contained ninety extracts from Shakespeare. In the same year was published
      the <i>Garden of the Muses</i>, containing several pieces from
      Shakespeare, Chapman, Marston and Ben Jonson. <i>England's Helicon</i> was
      printed in the same year, and contained poems from Spenser, Greene, Harvey
      and Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1600 a play was acted at Cambridge, in which Shakespeare was alluded to
      as follows: "Why, here's our fellow Shakespeare who puts them all down."
      John Weaver published a book of poems in 1595, in which there was a sonnet
      to Shakespeare. In 1598 Richard Bamfield wrote a poem to Shakespeare.
      Francis Meres, "clergyman, master of arts in both universities, compiler
      of school books," was the author of the <i>Wits Treasury</i>. In this he
      compares the ancient and modern tragic poets, and mentions Marlowe, Peele,
      Kyd and Shakespeare. So he compares the writers of comedies, and mentions
      Lilly, Lodge, Greene and Shakespeare. He speaks of elegiac poets, and
      names Surrey, Wyatt, Sidney, Raleigh and Shakespeare. He compares the
      lyric poets, and names Spenser, Drayton, Shakespeare and others. This same
      writer, speaking of Horace, says that England has Sidney, Shakespeare and
      others, and that "as the soul of Euphorbus was thought to live in
      Pythagoras, so the sweet-wittie soul of Ovid lives in the mellifluous and
      honey-tongued Shakespeare." He also says: "If the Muses could speak
      English, they would speak in Shakespeare's phrase." This was in 1598. In
      1607, John Davies alludes in a poem to Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course we are all familiar with what rare Ben Jonson wrote. Henry
      Chettle took Shakespeare to task because he wrote nothing on the death of
      Queen Elizabeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be wonderful that he was not better known. But is it not wonderful
      that he gained the reputation that he did in so short a time, and that
      twelve years after he began to write he stood at least with the first?
    </p>
    <p>
      III.
    </p>
    <p>
      BUT there is a wonderful fact connected with the writings of Shakespeare:
      In the Plays there is no direct mention of any of his contemporaries. We
      do not know of any poet, author, soldier, sailor, statesman, priest,
      nobleman, king, or queen, that Shakespeare directly mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not marvelous that he, living in an age of great deeds, of
      adventures in far-off lands and unknown seas&mdash;in a time of religious
      wars&mdash;in the days of the Armada&mdash;the massacre of St. Bartholomew&mdash;the
      Edict of Nantes&mdash;the assassination of Henry III.&mdash;the victory of
      Lepanto&mdash;the execution of Marie Stuart&mdash;did not mention the name
      of any man or woman of his time? Some have insisted that the paragraph
      ending with the lines: "The imperial votress passed on in maiden
      meditation fancy-free," referred to Queen Elizabeth; but it is impossible
      for me to believe that the daubed and wrinkled face, the small black eyes,
      the cruel nose, the thin lips, the bad teeth, and the red wig of Queen
      Elizabeth could by any possibility have inspired these marvelous lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perfectly apparent from Shakespeare's writings that he knew but
      little of the nobility, little of kings and queens. He gives to these
      supposed great people great thoughts, and puts great words in their mouths
      and makes them speak&mdash;not as they really did&mdash;but as Shakespeare
      thought such people should. This demonstrates that he did not know them
      personally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some have insisted that Shakespeare mentions Queen Elizabeth in the last
      scene of Henry VIII. The answer to this is that Shakespeare did not write
      the last scene in that Play. The probability is that Fletcher was the
      author.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare lived during the great awakening of the world, when Europe
      emerged from the darkness of the Middle Ages, when the discovery of
      America had made England, that blossom of the Gulf-Stream, the centre of
      commerce, and during a period when some of the greatest writers, thinkers,
      soldiers and discoverers were produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cervantes was born in 1547, dying on the same day that Shakespeare died.
      He was undoubtedly the greatest writer that Spain has produced. Rubens was
      born in 1577. Camoens, the Portuguese, the author of the <i>Lusiad</i>,
      died in 1597. Giordano Bruno&mdash;greatest of martyrs&mdash;was born in
      1548&mdash;visited London in Shakespeare's time&mdash;delivered lectures
      at Oxford, and called that institution "the widow of learning." Drake
      circled the globe in 1580. Galileo was born in 1564&mdash;the same year
      with Shakespeare. Michael Angelo died in 1563. Kepler&mdash;he of the
      Three Laws&mdash;born in 1571. Calderon, the Spanish dramatist, born in
      1601. Corneille, the French poet, in 1606. Rembrandt, greatest of
      painters, 1607. Shakespeare was born in 1564. In that year John Calvin
      died. What a glorious exchange!
    </p>
    <p>
      Seventy-two years after the discovery of America Shakespeare was born, and
      England was filled with the voyages and discoveries written by Hakluyt,
      and the wonders that had been seen by Raleigh, by Drake, by Frobisher and
      Hawkins. London had become the centre of the world, and representatives
      from all known countries were in the new metropolis. The world had been
      doubled. The imagination had been touched and kindled by discovery. In the
      far horizon were unknown lands, strange shores beyond untraversed seas.
      Toward every part of the world were turned the prows of adventure. All
      these things fanned the imagination into flame, and this had its effect
      upon the literary and dramatic world. And yet Shakespeare&mdash;the master
      spirit of mankind&mdash;in the midst of these discoveries, of these
      adventures, mentioned no navigator, no general, no discoverer, no
      philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Galileo was reading the open volume of the sky, but Shakespeare did not
      mention him. This to me is the most marvelous thing connected with this
      most marvelous man.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time England was prosperous&mdash;was then laying the foundation
      of her future greatness and power.
    </p>
    <p>
      When men are prosperous, they are in love with life. Nature grows
      beautiful, the arts begin to flourish, there is work for painter and
      sculptor, the poet is born, the stage is erected&mdash;and this life with
      which men are in love, is represented in a thousand forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nature, or Fate, or Chance prepared a stage for Shakespeare, and
      Shakespeare prepared a stage for Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Famine and faith go together. In disaster and want the gaze of man is
      fixed upon another world. He that eats a crust has a creed. Hunger falls
      upon its knees, and heaven, looked for through tears, is the mirage of
      misery. But prosperity brings joy and wealth and leisure&mdash;and the
      beautiful is born.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the effects of the world's awakening was Shakespeare. We account
      for this man as we do for the highest mountain, the greatest river, the
      most perfect gem. We can only say: He was.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "It hath been taught us from the primal state
     That he which is was wished until he were."
</pre>
    <p>
      IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      IN Shakespeare's time the actor was a vagabond, the dramatist a
      disreputable person&mdash;and yet the greatest dramas were then written.
      In spite of law, and social ostracism, Shakespeare reared the many-colored
      dome that fills and glorifies the intellectual heavens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the whole civilized world believes in the theatre&mdash;asks for some
      great dramatist&mdash;is hungry for a play worthy of the century, is
      anxious to give gold and fame to any one who can worthily put our age upon
      the stage&mdash;and yet no great play has been written since Shakespeare
      died.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare pursued the highway of the right. He did not seek to put his
      characters in a position where it was right to do wrong. He was sound and
      healthy to the centre. It never occurred to him to write a play in which a
      wife's lover should be jealous of her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was in his blood the courage of his thought. He was true to himself
      and enjoyed the perfect freedom of the highest art. He did not write
      according to rules&mdash;but smaller men make rules from what he wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      How fortunate that Shakespeare was not educated at Oxford&mdash;that the
      winged god within him never knelt to the professor. How fortunate that
      this giant was not captured, tied and tethered by the literary
      Lilliputians of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an idealist. He did not&mdash;like most writers of our time&mdash;take
      refuge in the real, hiding a lack of genius behind a pretended love of
      truth. All realities are not poetic, or dramatic, or even worth knowing.
      The real sustains the same relation to the ideal that a stone does to a
      statue&mdash;or that paint does to a painting. Realism degrades and
      impoverishes. In no event can a realist be more than an imitator and
      copyist. According to the realist's philosophy, the wax that receives and
      retains an image is an artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare did not rely on the stage-carpenter, or the scenic painter. He
      put his scenery in his lines. There you will find mountains and rivers and
      seas, valleys and cliffs, violets and clouds, and over all "the firmament
      fretted with gold and fire." He cared little for plot, little for
      surprise. He did not rely on stage effects, or red fire. The plays grow
      before your eyes, and they come as the morning comes. Plot surprises but
      once. There must be something in a play besides surprise. Plot in an
      author is a kind of strategy&mdash;that is to say, a sort of cunning, and
      cunning does not belong to the highest natures.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in Shakespeare such a wealth of thought that the plot becomes
      almost immaterial&mdash;and such is this wealth that you can hardly know
      the play&mdash;there is too much. After you have heard it again and again,
      it seems as pathless as an untrodden forest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He belonged to all lands. "Timon of Athens" is as Greek as any tragedy of
      Eschylus. "Julius C&aelig;sar" and "Coriolanus" are perfect Roman, and as
      you read, the mighty ruins rise and the Eternal City once again becomes
      the mistress of the world. No play is more Egyptian than "Antony and
      Cleopatra"&mdash;the Nile runs through it, the shadows of the pyramids
      fall upon it, and from its scenes the Sphinx gazes forever on the
      outstretched sands.
    </p>
    <p>
      In "Lear" is the true pagan spirit. "Romeo and Juliet" is Italian&mdash;everything
      is sudden, love bursts into immediate flower, and in every scene is the
      climate of the land of poetry and passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reason of this is that Shakespeare dealt with elemental things, with
      universal man. He knew that locality colors without changing, and that in
      all surroundings the human heart is substantially the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not all the poetry written before his time would make his sum&mdash;not
      all that has been written since, added to all that was written before,
      would equal his.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing within the range of human thought, within the horizon of
      intellectual effort, that he did not touch. He knew the brain and heart of
      man&mdash;the theories, customs, superstitions, hopes, fears, hatreds,
      vices and virtues of the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew the thrills and ecstasies of love, the savage joys of hatred and
      revenge. He heard the hiss of envy's snakes and watched the eagles of
      ambition soar. There was no hope that did not put its star above his head&mdash;no
      fear he had not felt&mdash;no joy that had not shed its sunshine on his
      face. He experienced the emotions of mankind. He was the intellectual
      spendthrift of the world. He gave with the generosity, the extravagance,
      of madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read one play, and you are impressed with the idea that the wealth of the
      brain of a god has been exhausted&mdash;that there are no more
      comparisons, no more passions to be expressed, no more definitions, no
      more philosophy, beauty, or sublimity to be put in words&mdash;and yet,
      the next play opens as fresh as the dewy gates of another day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outstretched wings of his imagination filled the sky. He was the
      intellectual crown o' the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      V.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE plays of Shakespeare show so much knowledge, thought and learning,
      that many people&mdash;those who imagine that universities furnish
      capacity&mdash;contend that Bacon must have been the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know Bacon. We know that he was a scheming politician, a courtier, a
      time-server of church and king, and a corrupt judge. We know that he never
      admitted the truth of the Copernican system&mdash;that he was doubtful
      whether instruments were of any advantage in scientific investigation&mdash;that
      he was ignorant of the higher branches of mathematics, and that, as a
      matter of fact, he added but little to the knowledge of the world. When he
      was more than sixty years of age he turned his attention to poetry, and
      dedicated his verses to George Herbert.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you will read these verses you will say that the author of "Lear" and
      "Hamlet" did not write them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon dedicated his work on the <i>Advancement of Learning, Divine and
      Human</i>, to James I., and in his dedication he stated that there had not
      been, since the time of Christ, any king or monarch so learned in all
      erudition, divine or human. He placed James the First before Marcus
      Aurelius and all other kings and emperors since Christ, and concluded by
      saying that James the First had "the power and fortune of a king, the
      illumination of a priest, the learning and universality of a philosopher."
      This was written of James the First, described by Macaulay as a
      "stammering, slobbering, trembling coward, whose writings were deformed by
      the grossest and vilest superstitions&mdash;witches being the special
      objects of his fear, his hatred, and his persecution."
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems to have been taken for granted that if Shakespeare was not the
      author of the great dramas, Lord Bacon must have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been claimed that Bacon was the greatest philosopher of his time.
      And yet in reading his works we find that there was in his mind a strange
      mingling of foolishness and philosophy. He takes pains to tell us, and to
      write it down for the benefit of posterity, that "snow is colder than
      water, because it hath more spirit in it, and that quicksilver is the
      coldest of all metals, because it is the fullest of spirit."
    </p>
    <p>
      He stated that he hardly believed that you could contract air by putting
      opium on top of the weather glass, and gave the following reason:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I conceive that opium and the like make spirits fly rather by malignity
      than by cold."
    </p>
    <p>
      This great philosopher gave the following recipe for staunching blood:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thrust the part that bleedeth into the body of a capon, new ripped and
      bleeding. This will staunch the blood. The blood, as it seemeth, sucking
      and drawing up by similitude of substance the blood it meeteth with, and
      so itself going back."
    </p>
    <p>
      The philosopher also records this important fact: "Divers witches among
      heathen and Christians have fed upon man's flesh to aid, as it seemeth,
      their imagination with high and foul vapors."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bacon was not only a philosopher, but he was a biologist, as appears
      from the following:
    </p>
    <p>
      "As for living creatures, it is certain that their vital spirits are a
      substance compounded of an airy and flamy matter, and although air and
      flame being free will not mingle, yet bound in by a body that hath some
      fixing, will."
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then the inventor of deduction reasons by analogy. He says:
    </p>
    <p>
      "As snow and ice holpen, and their cold activated by nitre or salt, will
      turn water into ice, so it may be it will turn wood or stiff clay into
      stone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon seems to have been a believer in the transmutation of metals, and
      solemnly gives a formula for changing silver or copper into gold. He also
      believed in the transmutation of plants, and had arrived at such a height
      in entomology that he informed the world that "insects have no blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is claimed that he was a great observer, and as evidence of this he
      recorded the wonderful fact that "tobacco cut and dried by the fire loses
      weight" that "bears in the winter wax fat in sleep, though they eat
      nothing" that "tortoises have no bones" that "there is a kind of stone, if
      ground and put in water where cattle drink, the cows will give more milk"
      that "it is hard to cure a hurt in a Frenchman's head, but easy in his
      leg;" that "it is hard to cure a hurt in an Englishman's leg, but easy in
      his head;" that "wounds made with brass weapons are easier to cure than
      those made with iron;" that "lead will multiply and increase, as in
      statues buried in the ground" and that "the rainbow touching anything
      causeth a sweet smell."
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon seems also to have turned his attention to ornithology, and says
      that "eggs laid in the full of the moon breed better birds," and that "you
      can make swallows white by putting ointment on the eggs before they are
      hatched."
    </p>
    <p>
      He also informs us "that witches cannot hurt kings as easily as they can
      common people" that "perfumes dry and strengthen the brain" that "any one
      in the moment of triumph can be injured by another who casts an envious
      eye, and the injury is greatest when the envious glance comes from the
      oblique eye."
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Bacon also turned his attention to medicine, and he states that
      "bracelets made of snakes are good for curing cramps" that "the skin of a
      wolf might cure the colic, because a wolf has great digestion" that
      "eating the roasted brains of hens and hares strengthens the memory" that
      "if a woman about to become a mother eats a good many quinces and
      considerable coriander seed, the child will be ingenious," and that "the
      moss which groweth on the skull of an unburied dead man is good for
      staunching blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      He expresses doubt, however, "as to whether you can cure a wound by
      putting ointment on the weapon that caused the wound, instead of on the
      wound itself."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is claimed by the advocates of the Baconian theory that their hero
      stood at the top of science; and yet "it is absolutely certain that he was
      ignorant of the law of the acceleration of falling bodies, although the
      law had been made known and printed by Galileo thirty years before Bacon
      wrote upon the subject. Neither did this great man understand the
      principle of the lever. He was not acquainted with the precession of the
      equinoxes, and as a matter of fact was ill-read in those branches of
      learning in which, in his time, the most rapid progress had been made."
    </p>
    <p>
      After Kepler discovered his third law, which was on the 15th of May, 1618,
      Bacon was more than ever opposed to the Copernican system. This great man
      was far behind his own time, not only in astronomy, but in mathematics. In
      the preface to the "De-scriptio Globi Intellectualis," it is admitted
      either that Bacon had never heard of the correction of the parallax, or
      was unable to understand it. He complained on account of the want of some
      method for shortening mathematical calculations; and yet "Napier's
      Logarithms" had been printed nine years before the date of his complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      He attempted to form a table of specific gravities by a rude process of
      his own, a process that no one has ever followed; and he did this in spite
      of the fact that a far better method existed.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have the right to compare what Bacon wrote with what it is claimed
      Shakespeare produced. I call attention to one thing&mdash;to Bacon's
      opinion of human love. It is this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The stage is more beholding to love than the life of man. As to the
      stage, love is ever matter of comedies and now and then of tragedies, but
      in life it doth much mischief&mdash;sometimes like a siren, sometimes like
      a fury. Amongst all the great and worthy persons there is not one that
      hath been transported to the mad degree of love, which shows that great
      spirits and great business do keep out this weak passion."
    </p>
    <p>
      The author of "Romeo and Juliet" never wrote that.
    </p>
    <p>
      It seems certain that the author of the wondrous Plays was one of the
      noblest of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us see what sense of honor Bacon had.
    </p>
    <p>
      In writing commentaries on certain passages of Scripture, Lord Bacon tells
      a courtier, who has committed some offence, how to get back into the
      graces of his prince or king. Among other things he tells him not to
      appear too cheerful, but to assume a very grave and modest face; not to
      bring the matter up himself; to be extremely industrious, so that the
      prince will see that it is hard to get along without him; also to get his
      friends to tell the prince or king how badly he, the courtier, feels; and
      then he says, all these failing, "let him contrive to transfer the fault
      to others."
    </p>
    <p>
      It is true that we know but little of Shakespeare, and consequently do not
      positively know that he did not have the ability to write the Plays&mdash;but
      we do know Bacon, and we know that he could not have written these Plays&mdash;consequently,
      they must have been written by a comparatively unknown man&mdash;that is
      to say, by a man who was known by no other writings. The fact that we do
      not know Shakespeare, except through the Plays and Sonnets, makes it
      possible for us to believe that he was the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some people have imagined that the Plays were written by several&mdash;but
      this only increases the wonder, and adds a useless burden to credulity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon published in his time all the writings that he claimed. Naturally,
      he would have claimed his best. Is it possible that Bacon left the
      wondrous children of his brain on the door-step of Shakespeare, and kept
      the deformed ones at home? Is it possible that he fathered the failures
      and deserted the perfect?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, it is wonderful that so little has been found touching
      Shakespeare&mdash;but is it not equally wonderful, if Bacon was the
      author, that not a line has been found in all his papers, containing a
      suggestion, or a hint, that he was the writer of these Plays? Is it not
      wonderful that no fragment of any scene&mdash;no line&mdash;no word&mdash;has
      been found?
    </p>
    <p>
      Some have insisted that Bacon kept the authorship secret because it was
      disgraceful to write Plays. This argument does not cover the Sonnets&mdash;and
      besides, one who had been stripped of the robes of office for receiving
      bribes as a judge, could have borne the additional disgrace of having
      written "Hamlet." The fact that Bacon did not claim to be the author,
      demonstrates that he was not. Shakespeare claimed to be the author, and no
      one in his time or day denied the claim. This demonstrates that he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon published his works, and said to the world: This is what I have
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suppose you found in a cemetery a monument erected to John Smith, inventor
      of the Smith-churn, and suppose you were told that Mr. Smith provided for
      the monument in his will, and dictated the inscription&mdash;would it be
      possible to convince you that Mr. Smith was also the inventor of the
      locomotive and telegraph?
    </p>
    <p>
      Bacon's best can be compared with Shakespeare's common, but Shakespeare's
      best rises above Bacon's best, like a domed temple above a beggar's hut.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI.
    </p>
    <p>
      OF course it is admitted that there were many dramatists before and during
      the time of Shakespeare&mdash;but they were only the foot hills of that
      mighty peak the top of which the clouds and mists still hide. Chapman and
      Marlowe, Heywood and Jonson, Webster, Beaumont and Fletcher wrote some
      great lines, and in the monotony of declamation now and then is found a
      strain of genuine music&mdash;but all of them together constituted only a
      herald of Shakespeare. In all these Plays there is but a hint, a prophecy,
      of the great drama destined to revolutionize the poetic thought of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was the greatest of poets. What Greece and Rome produced was
      great until his time. "Lions make leopards tame."
    </p>
    <p>
      The great poet is a great artist. He is painter and sculptor. The greatest
      pictures and statues have been painted and chiseled with words. They
      outlast all others. All the galleries of the world are poor and cheap
      compared with the statues and pictures in Shakespeare's book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Language is made of pictures represented by sounds. The outer world is a
      dictionary of the mind, and the artist called the soul uses this
      dictionary of things to express what happens in the noiseless and
      invisible world of thought. First a sound represents something in the
      outer world, and afterwards something in the inner, and this sound at last
      is represented by a mark, and this mark stands for a picture, and every
      brain is a gallery, and the artists&mdash;that is to say, the souls&mdash;exchange
      pictures and statues.
    </p>
    <p>
      All art is of the same parentage. The poet uses words&mdash;makes pictures
      and statues of sounds. The sculptor expresses harmony, proportion,
      passion, in marble; the composer, in music; the painter in form and color.
      The dramatist expresses himself not only in words, not only paints these
      pictures, but he expresses his thought in action.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was not only a poet, but a dramatist, and expressed the ideal,
      the poetic, not only in words, but in action. There are the wit, the
      humor, the pathos, the tragedy of situation, of relation. The dramatist
      speaks and acts through others&mdash;his personality is lost. The poet
      lives in the world of thought and feeling, and to this the dramatist adds
      the world of action. He creates characters that seem to act in accordance
      with their own natures and independently of him. He compresses lives into
      hours, tells us the secrets of the heart, shows us the springs of action&mdash;how
      desire bribes the judgment and corrupts the will&mdash;how weak the reason
      is when passion pleads, and how grand it is to stand for right against the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not enough to say fine things,&mdash;great things, dramatic things,
      must be done.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me give you an illustration of dramatic incident accompanying the
      highest form of poetic expression:
    </p>
    <p>
      Macbeth having returned from the murder of Duncan says to his wife:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Methought I heard a voice cry: Sleep no more,
     Macbeth does murder sleep; the innocent sleep;
     Sleep, that knits up the ravelled sleeve of care,
     The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,
     Balm of hurt minds, great Nature's second course,
     Chief nourisher in life's feast."...

     "Still it cried: Sleep no more, to all the house,
     Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor
     Shall sleep no more&mdash;Macbeth shall sleep no more."
</pre>
    <p>
      She exclaims:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Who was it that thus cried?
     Why, worthy Thane, you do unbend your noble strength
     To think so brain-sickly of things; get some water,
     And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
     Why did you bring the daggers from the place?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Macbeth was so overcome with horror at his own deed, that he not only
      mistook his thoughts for the words of others, but was so carried away and
      beyond himself that he brought with him the daggers&mdash;the evidence of
      his guilt&mdash;the daggers that he should have left with the dead. This
      is dramatic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same play, the difference of feeling before and after the
      commission of a crime is illustrated to perfection. When Macbeth is on his
      way to assassinate the king, the bell strikes, and he says, or whispers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Hear it not, Duncan, for it is a knell."
</pre>
    <p>
      Afterward, when the deed has been committed, and a knocking is heard at
      the gate, he cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Wake Duncan with thy knocking. I would thou couldst."
</pre>
    <p>
      Let me give one more instance of dramatic action. When Antony speaks above
      the body of C&aelig;sar he says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "You all do know this mantle:
     I remember The first time ever C&aelig;sar put it on&mdash;
     'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
     That day he overcame the Nervii:
     Look! In this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
     See what a rent the envious Casca made!
     Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabbed,
     And as he plucked his cursed steel away,
     Mark how the blood of C&aelig;sar followed it."
</pre>
    <p>
      VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      THERE are men, and many of them, who are always trying to show that
      somebody else chiseled the statue or painted the picture,&mdash;that the
      poem is attributed to the wrong man, and that the battle was really won by
      a subordinate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course Shakespeare made use of the work of others&mdash;and, we might
      almost say, of all others. Every writer must use the work of others. The
      only question is, how the accomplishments of other minds are used, whether
      as a foundation to build higher, or whether stolen to the end that the
      thief may make a reputation for himself, without adding to the great
      structure of literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands of people have stolen stones from the Coliseum to make huts for
      themselves. So thousands of writers have taken the thoughts of others with
      which to adorn themselves. These are plagiarists. But the man who takes
      the thought of another, adds to it, gives it intensity and poetic form,
      throb and life,&mdash;is in the highest sense original.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare found nearly all of his facts in the writings of others, and
      was indebted to others for most of the stories of his plays. The question
      is not: Who furnished the stone, or who owned the quarry, but who chiseled
      the statue?
    </p>
    <p>
      We now know all the books that Shakespeare could have read, and
      consequently know many of the sources of his information. We find in
      Pliny's <i>Natural History</i>, published in 1601, the following: "The sea
      Pontis evermore floweth and runneth out into the Propontis; but the sea
      never retireth back again with the Impontis." This was the raw material,
      and out of it Shakespeare made the following:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Like to the Pontic Sea,
     Whose icy current and compulsive course
     Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
     To the Propontic and the Hellespont&mdash;
     Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
     Shall ne'er turn back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
     Till that a capable and wide revenge Swallow them up."
</pre>
    <p>
      Perhaps we can give an idea of the difference between Shakespeare and
      other poets, by a passage from "Lear." When Cordelia places her hand upon
      her father's head and speaks of the night and of the storm, an ordinary
      poet might have said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "On such a night, a dog
     Should have stood against my fire."
</pre>
    <p>
      A very great poet might have gone a step further and exclaimed:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "On such a night, mine enemy's dog
     Should have stood against my fire."
</pre>
    <p>
      But Shakespeare said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Mine enemy's dog, though he had bit me,
     Should have stood, that night, against my fire."
</pre>
    <p>
      Of all the poets&mdash;of all the writers&mdash;Shakespeare is the most
      original. He is as original as Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may truthfully be said that "Nature wants stuff to vie strange forms
      with fancy, to make another."
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      THERE is in the greatest poetry a kind of extravagance that touches the
      infinite, and in this Shakespeare exceeds all others.
    </p>
    <p>
      You will remember the description given of the voyage of Paris in search
      of Helen:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "The seas and winds, old wranglers, made a truce,
     And did him service; he touched the ports desired,
     And for an old aunt, whom the Greeks held captive,
     He brought a Grecian queen whose youth and freshness
     Wrinkles Apollo, and makes stale the morning."
</pre>
    <p>
      So, in Pericles, when the father finds his daughter, he cries out:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "O Helicanus! strike me, honored sir;
     Give me a gash, put me to present pain,
     Lest this great sea of joys, rushing upon me,
     O'erbear the shores of my mortality."
</pre>
    <p>
      The greatest compliment that man has ever paid to the woman he adores is
      this line:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Eyes that do mislead the morn."
</pre>
    <p>
      Nothing can be conceived more perfectly poetic. In that marvelous play,
      the "Midsummer Night's Dream," is one of the most extravagant things in
      literature:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Thou rememberest Since once I sat upon a promontory,
     And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
     Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
     That the rude sea grew civil at her song,
     And certain stars shot madly from their spheres
     To hear the sea-maid's music."
</pre>
    <p>
      This is so marvelously told that it almost seems probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the description of Mark Antony:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "For his bounty
     There was no winter in't&mdash;an autumn t'was
     That grew the more by reaping.

     His delights
     Were dolphin-like&mdash;they showed his back above
     The element they lived in."

     With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
     Injurious time now with a robber's haste
     Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how;
     As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
     With distinct breath and consigned kisses to them,
     He fumbles up into a loos'e adieu,
     And scants us with a single famished kiss,
     Distasted with the salt of broken tears."

      Often when reading the marvelous lines of Shakespeare, I feel that his
      thoughts are "too subtle potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness, for the
      capacity of my ruder powers." Sometimes I cry out, "O churl!&mdash;write
      all, and leave no thoughts for those who follow after."
    </p>

      IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      SHAKESPEARE was an innovator, an iconoclast. He cared nothing for the
      authority of men or of schools. He violated the "unities," and cared
      nothing for the models of the ancient world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greeks insisted that nothing should be in a play that did not tend to
      the catastrophe. They did not believe in the episode&mdash;in the sudden
      contrasts of light and shade&mdash;in mingling the comic and the tragic.
      The sunlight never fell upon their tears, and darkness did not overtake
      their laughter. They believed that nature sympathized or was in harmony
      with the events of the play. When crime was about to be committed&mdash;some
      horror to be perpetrated&mdash;the light grew dim, the wind sighed, the
      trees shivered, and upon all was the shadow of the coming event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare knew that the play had little to do with the tides and
      currents of universal life&mdash;that Nature cares neither for smiles nor
      tears, for life nor death, and that the sun shines as gladly on coffins as
      on cradles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first time I visited the Place de la Concorde, where during the French
      Revolution stood the guillotine, and where now stands an Egyptian obelisk&mdash;a
      bird, sitting on the top, was singing with all its might.&mdash;Nature
      forgets.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most notable instances of the violation by Shakespeare of the
      classic model, is found in the 6th scene of the I. Act of Macbeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the King and Banquo approach the castle in which the King is to be
      murdered that night, no shadow falls athwart the threshold. So beautiful
      is the scene that the King says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
     Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
     Unto our gentle senses."
</pre>
    <p>
      And Banquo adds:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "This guest of summer,
     The temple-haunting martlet, does approve
     By his loved mansionry that the heaven's breath
     Smells wooingly here; no jutty, frieze,
     Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
     Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle.
     Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed
     The air is delicate."
</pre>
    <p>
      Another notable instance is the porter scene immediately following the
      murder. So, too, the dialogue with the clown who brings the asp to
      Cleopatra just before the suicide, illustrates my meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      I know of one paragraph in the Greek drama worthy of Shakespeare. This is
      in "Medea." When Medea kills her children she curses Jason, using the
      ordinary Billingsgate and papal curse, but at the conclusion says: "I pray
      the gods to make him virtuous, that he may the more deeply feel the pang
      that I inflict."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare dealt in lights and shadows. He was intense. He put noons and
      midnights side by side. No other dramatist would have dreamed of adding to
      the pathos&mdash;of increasing our appreciation of Lear's agony, by
      supplementing the wail of the mad king with the mocking laughter of a
      loving clown.

      THE ordinary dramatists&mdash;the men of talent&mdash;(and there is the
      same difference between talent and genius that there is between a
      stone-mason and a sculptor) create characters that become types. Types are
      of necessity caricatures&mdash;actual men and women are to some extent
      contradictory in their actions. Types are blown in the one direction by
      the one wind&mdash;characters have pilots.
    </p>
    <p>
      In real people, good and evil mingle. Types are all one way, or all the
      other&mdash;all good, or all bad, all wise, or all foolish.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pecksniff was a perfect type, a perfect hypocrite&mdash;and will remain a
      type as long as language lives&mdash;a hypocrite that even drunkenness
      could not change. Everybody understands Pecksniff, and compared with him
      Tartuffe was an honest man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet is an individual, a person, an actual being&mdash;and for that
      reason there is a difference of opinion as to his motives and as to his
      character. We differ about Hamlet as we do about C&aelig;sar, or about
      Shakespeare himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hamlet saw the ghost of his father and heard again his fathers voice, and
      yet, afterward, he speaks of "the undiscovered country from whose bourne
      no traveler returns."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this there is no contradiction. The reason outweighs the senses. If we
      should see a dead man rise from his grave, we would not, the next day,
      believe that we did. No one can credit a miracle until it becomes so
      common that it ceases to be miraculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Types are puppets&mdash;controlled from without&mdash;characters act from
      within. There is the same difference between characters and types that
      there is between springs and water-works, between canals and rivers,
      between wooden soldiers and heroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most plays and in most novels the characters are so shadowy that we
      have to piece them out with the imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      One waking in the morning sometimes sees at the foot of his bed a strange
      figure&mdash;it may be of an ancient lady with cap and ruffles and with
      the expression of garrulous and fussy old age&mdash;but when the light
      gets stronger, the figure gradually changes and he sees a few clothes on a
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dramatist lives the lives of others, and in order to delineate
      character must not only have imagination but sympathy with the character
      delineated. The great dramatist thinks of a character as an entirety, as
      an individual.
    </p>
    <p>
      I once had a dream, and in this dream I was discussing a subject with
      another man. It occurred to me that I was dreaming, and I then said to
      myself: If this is a dream, I am doing the talking for both sides&mdash;consequently
      I ought to know in advance what the other man is going to say. In my dream
      I tried the experiment. I then asked the other man a question, and before
      he answered made up my mind what the answer was to be. To my surprise, the
      man did not say what I expected he would, and so great was my astonishment
      that I awoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      It then occurred to me that I had discovered the secret of Shakespeare. He
      did, when awake, what I did when asleep&mdash;that is, he threw off a
      character so perfect that it acted independently of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the delineation of character Shakespeare has no rivals. He creates no
      monsters. His characters do not act without reason, without motive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iago had his reasons. In Caliban, nature was not destroyed&mdash;and Lady
      Macbeth certifies that the woman still was in her heart, by saying:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Had he not resembled my father as he slept, I had done it."
</pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare's characters act from within. They are centres of energy. They
      are not pushed by unseen hands, or pulled by unseen strings. They have
      objects, desires. They are persons&mdash;real, living beings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Few dramatists succeed in getting their characters loose from the canvas&mdash;their
      backs stick to the wall&mdash;they do not have free and independent action&mdash;they
      have no background, no unexpressed motives&mdash;no untold desires. They
      lack the complexity of the real.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare makes the character true to itself. Christopher Sly,
      surrounded by the luxuries of a lord, true to his station, calls for a pot
      of the smallest ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take one expression by Lady Macbeth. You remember that after the murder is
      discovered&mdash;after the alarm bell is rung&mdash;she appears upon the
      scene wanting to know what has happened. Macduff refuses to tell her,
      saying that the slightest word would murder as it fell. At this moment
      Banquo comes upon the scene and Macduff cries out to him:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Our royal master's murdered."
</pre>
    <p>
      What does Lady Macbeth then say? She in fact makes a confession of guilt.
      The weak point in the terrible tragedy is that Duncan was murdered in
      Macbeth's castle. So when Lady Macbeth hears what they suppose is news to
      her, she cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "What! In our house!"
</pre>
    <p>
      Had she been innocent, her horror of the crime would have made her forget
      the place&mdash;the venue. Banquo sees through this, and sees through her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her expression was a light, by which he saw her guilt&mdash;and he
      answers:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Too cruel anywhere."
</pre>
    <p>
      No matter whether Shakespeare delineated clown or king, warrior or maiden&mdash;no
      matter whether his characters are taken from the gutter or the throne&mdash;each
      is a work of consummate art, and when he is unnatural, he is so splendid
      that the defect is forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Romeo is told of the death of Juliet, and thereupon makes up his mind
      to die upon her grave, he gives a description of the shop where poison
      could be purchased. He goes into particulars and tells of the alligators
      stuffed, of the skins of ill-shaped fishes, of the beggarly account of
      empty boxes, of the remnants of pack-thread, and old cakes of roses&mdash;and
      while it is hardly possible to believe that under such circumstances a man
      would take the trouble to make an inventory of a strange kind of
      drug-store, yet the inventory is so perfect&mdash;the picture is so
      marvelously drawn&mdash;that we forget to think whether it is natural or
      not.
    </p>
    <p>
      In making the frame of a great picture&mdash;of a great scene&mdash;Shakespeare
      was often careless, but the picture is perfect. In making the sides of the
      arch he was negligent, but when he placed the keystone, it burst into
      blossom. Of course there are many lines in Shakespeare that never should
      have been written. In other words, there are imperfections in his plays.
      But we must remember that Shakespeare furnished the torch that enables us
      to see these imperfections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare speaks through his characters, and we must not mistake what
      the characters say, for the opinion of Shakespeare. No one can believe
      that Shakespeare regarded life as "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound
      and fury, signifying nothing." That was the opinion of a murderer,
      surrounded by avengers, and whose wife&mdash;partner in his crimes&mdash;troubled
      with thick-coming fancies&mdash;had gone down to her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most actors and writers seem to suppose that the lines called "The Seven
      Ages" contain Shakespeare's view of human life. Nothing could be further
      from the truth. The lines were uttered by a cynic, in contempt and scorn
      of the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare did not put his characters in the livery and uniform of some
      weakness, peculiarity or passion. He did not use names as tags or brands.
      He did not write under the picture, "This is a villain." His characters
      need no suggestive names to tell us what they are&mdash;we see them and we
      know them for ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be that in the greatest utterances of the greatest characters in
      the supreme moments, we have the real thoughts, opinions and convictions
      of Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all writers Shakespeare is the most impersonal. He speaks through
      others, and the others seem to speak for themselves. The didactic is lost
      in the dramatic. He does not use the stage as a pulpit to enforce some
      maxim. He is as reticent as Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      He idealizes the common and transfigures all he touches&mdash;but he does
      not preach. He was interested in men and things as they were. He did not
      seek to change them&mdash;but to portray. He was Natures mirror&mdash;and
      in that mirror Nature saw herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I stood amid the great trees of California that lift their spreading
      capitals against the clouds, looking like Nature's columns to support the
      sky, I thought of the poetry of Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      THAT a procession of men and women&mdash;statesmen and warriors&mdash;kings
      and clowns&mdash;issued from Shakespeare's brain! What women!
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Isabella</i>&mdash;in whose spotless life love and reason blended into
      perfect truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Juliet</i>&mdash;within whose heart passion and purity met like white
      and red within the bosom of a rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Cordelia</i>&mdash;who chose to suffer loss, rather than show her
      wealth of love with those who gilded lies in hope of gain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Hermione</i>&mdash;"tender as infancy and grace"&mdash;who bore with
      perfect hope and faith the cross of shame, and who at last forgave with
      all her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Desdemona</i>&mdash;so innocent, so perfect, her love so pure, that she
      was incapable of suspecting that another could suspect, and who with dying
      words sought to hide her lover's crime&mdash;and with her last faint
      breath uttered a loving lie that burst into a perfumed lily between her
      pallid lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Perdita</i>&mdash;"a violet dim, and sweeter than the lids of Juno's
      eyes"&mdash;"The sweetest low-born lass that ever ran on the green sward."
      And
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Helena</i>&mdash;who said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I know I love in vain, strive against hope&mdash;
     Yet in this captious and intenable sieve
     I still pour in the waters of my love,
     And lack not to lose still,
     Thus, Indian-like,
     Religious in mine error, I adore
     The sun that looks upon his worshiper,
     But knows of him no more."
</pre>
    <p>
      <i>Miranda</i>&mdash;who told her love as gladly as a flower gives its
      bosom to the kisses of the sun. And <i>Cordelia</i>&mdash;whose kisses
      cured and whose tears restored. And stainless
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Imogen</i>&mdash;who cried: "What is it to be false?" And here is the
      description of the perfect woman:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "To feed for aye her lamp and flames of love;
     To keep her constancy in plight and youth&mdash;
     Outliving beauty's outward with a mind
     That doth renew swifter than blood decays."
</pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare has done more for woman than all the other dramatists of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part, I love the Clowns. I love <i>Launce</i> and his dog Crabb,
      and <i>Gobbo</i>, whose conscience threw its arms around the neck of his
      heart, and <i>Touchstone</i>, with his lie seven times removed; and dear
      old <i>Dogberry</i>&mdash;a pretty piece of flesh, tedious as a king. And
      <i>Bottom</i>, the very paramour for a sweet voice, longing to take the
      part to tear a cat in; and <i>Autolycus</i>, the snapper-up of
      unconsidered trifles, sleeping out the thought for the life to come. And
      great <i>Sir John</i>, without conscience, and for that reason unblamed
      and enjoyed&mdash;and who at the end babbles of green fields, and is
      almost loved. And ancient <i>Pistol</i>, the world his oyster. And <i>Bardolph</i>,
      with the flea on his blazing nose, putting beholders in mind of a damned
      soul in hell. And the poor <i>Pool</i>, who followed the mad king, and
      went "to bed at noon." And the clown who carried the worm of Nilus, whose
      "biting was immortal." And <i>Corin</i>, the shepherd&mdash;who described
      the perfect man: "I am a true laborer: I earn that I eat&mdash;get that I
      wear&mdash;owe no man aught&mdash;envy no man's happiness&mdash;glad of
      other men's good&mdash;content."
    </p>
    <p>
      And mingling in this motley throng, Lear, within whose brain a tempest
      raged until the depths were stirred, and the intellectual wealth of a life
      was given back to memory?&mdash;and then by madness thrown to storm and
      night&mdash;and when I read the living lines I feel as though I looked
      upon the sea and saw it wrought by frenzied whirlwinds, until the buried
      treasures and the sunken wrecks of all the years were cast upon the
      shores.
    </p>
    <p>
      And <i>Othello</i>&mdash;who like the base Indian threw a pearl away
      richer than all his tribe.
    </p>
    <p>
      And <i>Hamlet</i>&mdash;thought-entangled&mdash;hesitating between two
      worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      And <i>Macbeth</i>&mdash;strange mingling of cruelty and conscience,
      reaping the sure harvest of successful crime&mdash;"Curses not loud but
      deep&mdash;mouth-honor&mdash;breath."
    </p>
    <p>
      And <i>Brutus</i>, falling on his sword that C&aelig;sar might be still.
    </p>
    <p>
      And <i>Romeo</i>, dreaming of the white wonder of Juliet's hand. And <i>Ferdinand</i>,
      the patient log-man for Miranda's sake. And <i>Florizel</i>, who, "for all
      the sun sees, or the close earth wombs, or the profound seas hide," would
      not be faithless to the low-born lass. And <i>Constance</i>, weeping for
      her son, while grief "stuffs out his vacant garments with his form."
    </p>
    <p>
      And in the midst of tragedies and tears, of love and laughter and crime,
      we hear the voice of the good friar, who declares that in every human
      heart, as in the smallest flower, there are encamped the opposed hosts of
      good and evil&mdash;and our philosophy is interrupted by the garrulous old
      nurse, whose talk is as busily useless as the babble of a stream that
      hurries by a ruined mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      From every side the characters crowd upon us&mdash;the men and women born
      of Shakespeare's brain. They utter with a thousand voices the thoughts of
      the "myriad-minded" man, and impress themselves upon us as deeply and
      vividly as though they really lived with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare alone has delineated love in every possible phase&mdash;has
      ascended to the very top, and actually reached heights that no other has
      imagined. I do not believe the human mind will ever produce or be in a
      position to appreciate, a greater love-play than "Romeo and Juliet." It is
      a symphony in which all music seems to blend. The heart bursts into
      blossom, and he who reads feels the swooning intoxication of a divine
      perfume.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the alembic of Shakespeare's brain the baser metals were turned to gold&mdash;passions
      became virtues&mdash;weeds became exotics from some diviner land&mdash;and
      common mortals made of ordinary clay outranked the Olympian Gods. In his
      brain there was the touch of chaos that suggests the infinite&mdash;that
      belongs to genius. Talent is measured and mathematical&mdash;dominated by
      prudence and the thought of use. Genius is tropical. The creative instinct
      runs riot, delights in extravagance and waste, and overwhelms the mental
      beggars of the world with uncounted gold and unnumbered gems.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some things are immortal: The plays of Shakespeare, the marbles of the
      Greeks, and the music of Wagner.

    <p>
      SHAKESPEARE was the greatest of philosophers. He knew the conditions of
      success&mdash;of happiness&mdash;the relations that men sustain to each
      other, and the duties of all. He knew the tides and currents of the heart&mdash;the
      cliffs and caverns of the brain. He knew the weakness of the will, the
      sophistry of desire&mdash;and
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "That pleasure and revenge have ears more deaf than
     Adders to the voice of any true decision."

      He knew that the soul lives in an invisible world&mdash;that flesh is but

     "There is no art to find the mind's construction

      He knew that man is never master of the event, that he is to some extent
      the sport or prey of the blind forces of the world, and that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "In the reproof of chance lies the true proof of men."
</pre>
    <p>
      Feeling that the past is unchangeable, and that that which must happen is
      as much beyond control as though it had happened, he says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Let determined things to destiny
     Hold unbewailed their way."
</pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was great enough to know that every human being prefers
      happiness to misery, and that crimes are but mistakes. Looking in pity
      upon the human race, upon the pain and poverty, the crimes and cruelties,
      the limping travelers on the thorny paths, he was great and good enough to
      say:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "There is no darkness but ignorance."
</pre>
    <p>
      In all the philosophies there is no greater line. This great truth fills
      the heart with pity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that place and power do not give happiness&mdash;that the crowned
      are subject as the lowest to fate and chance.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "For within the hollow crown,
     That rounds the mortal temples of a king,
     Keeps death his court; and there the antick sits,
     Scoffing his state, and grinning at his pomp;
     Allowing him a breath, a little scene
     To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks;
     Infusing him with self and vain conceit.&mdash;
     As if this flesh, which walls about our life,
     Were brass impregnable; and, humour'd thus;
     Comes at the last, and with a little pin
     Bores through his castle wall, and&mdash;farewell king!"
</pre>
    <p>
      So, too, he knew that gold could not bring joy&mdash;that death and
      misfortune come alike to rich and poor, because:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "If thou art rich thou art poor;
     For like an ass whose back with ingots bows
     Thou bearest thy heavy riches but a journey,
     And death unloads thee."
</pre>
    <p>
      In some of his philosophy there was a kind of scorn&mdash;a hidden meaning
      that could not in his day and time have safely been expressed. You will
      remember that Laertes was about to kill the king, and this king was the
      murderer of his own brother, and sat upon the throne by reason of his
      crime&mdash;and in the mouth of such a king Shakespeare puts these words:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "There's such divinity doth hedge a king."
</pre>
    <p>
      So, in Macbeth:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                     "How he solicits
     Heaven himself best knows; but strangely visited people
     All swollen and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
     The mere despairs of surgery, he cures;
     Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
     Put on with holy prayers; and 'tis spoken
     To the succeeding royalty&mdash;he leaves
     The healing benediction.

     With this strange virtue
     He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
     And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
     That speak him full of grace."
</pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was the master of the human heart&mdash;knew all the hopes,
      fears, ambitions and passions that sway the mind of man; and thus knowing,
      he declared that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Love is not love that alters
     When it alteration finds."
</pre>
    <p>
      This is the sublimest declaration in the literature of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare seems to give the generalization&mdash;the result&mdash;without
      the process of thought. He seems always to be at the conclusion&mdash;standing
      where all truths meet.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of the Sonnets is this fragment of a line that contains the highest
      possible truth:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Conscience is born of love."
</pre>
    <p>
      If man were incapable of suffering, the words right and wrong never could
      have been spoken. If man were destitute of imagination, the flower of pity
      never could have blossomed in his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      We suffer&mdash;we cause others to suffer&mdash;those that we love&mdash;and
      of this fact conscience is born.
    </p>
    <p>
      Love is the many-colored flame that makes the fireside of the heart. It is
      the mingled spring and autumn&mdash;the perfect climate of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      IN the realm of comparison Shakespeare seems to have exhausted the
      relations, parallels and similitudes of things, He only could have said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Tedious as a twice-told tale
     Vexing the ears of a drowsy man."
     "Duller than a great thaw.
     Dry as the remainder biscuit after a voyage."
</pre>
    <p>
      In the words of Ulysses, spoken to Achilles, we find the most wonderful
      collection of pictures and comparisons ever compressed within the same
      number of lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
     Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,&mdash;
     A great-sized monster of ingratitudes&mdash;
     Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devoured
     As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
     As done; perseverance, dear my lord,
     Keeps honor bright: to have done is to hang
     Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
     In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
     For honor travels in a strait so narrow
     Where one but goes abreast; keep then the path;
     For emulation hath a thousand sons
     That one by one pursue; if you give way,
     Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
     Like to an entered tide, they all rush by
     And leave you hindmost:
     Or, like a gallant horse fallen in first rank,
     Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
     O'errun and trampled on: then what they do in present,
     Tho' less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
     For time is like a fashionable host
     That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
     And with his arms outstretched as he would fly,
     Grasps in the comer: Welcome ever smiles,
     And Farewell goes out sighing."
</pre>
    <p>
      So the words of Cleopatra, when Charmain speaks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Peace, peace:
     Dost thou not see my baby at my breast
     That sucks the nurse asleep?"
</pre>
    <p>
      XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      NOTHING is more difficult than a definition&mdash;a crystallization of
      thought so perfect that it emits light. Shakespeare says of suicide:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "It is great to do that thing
     That ends all other deeds,
     Which shackles accident, and bolts up change."
</pre>
    <p>
      He defines drama to be:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Turning the accomplishments of many years
     Into an hour glass."
</pre>
    <p>
      Of death:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "This sensible warm motion to become a kneaded clod,
     To lie in cold obstruction and to rot."
</pre>
    <p>
      Of memory:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "The warder of the brain."
</pre>
    <p>
      Of the body:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "This muddy vesture of decay."
</pre>
    <p>
      And he declares that
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Our little life is rounded with a sleep."
</pre>
    <p>
      He speaks of Echo as:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "The babbling gossip of the air"&mdash;
</pre>
    <p>
      Romeo, addressing the poison that he is about to take, says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Come, bitter conduct, come unsavory guide,
     Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
     The dashing rocks thy sea-sick, weary bark."
</pre>
    <p>
      He describes the world as
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "This bank and shoal of time."
</pre>
    <p>
      He says of rumor&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "That it doubles, like the voice and echo."
</pre>
    <p>
      It would take days to call attention to the perfect definitions,
      comparisons and generalizations of Shakespeare. He gave us the deeper
      meanings of our words&mdash;taught us the art of speech. He was the lord
      of language&mdash;master of expression and compression.
    </p>
    <p>
      He put the greatest thoughts into the shortest words&mdash;made the poor
      rich and the common royal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Production enriched his brain. Nothing exhausted him. The moment his
      attention was called to any subject&mdash;comparisons, definitions,
      metaphors and generalizations filled his mind and begged for utterance.
      His thoughts like bees robbed every blossom in the world, and then with
      "merry march" brought the rich booty home "to the tent royal of their
      emperor."
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was the confidant of Nature. To him she opened her "infinite
      book of secrecy," and in his brain were "the hatch and brood of time."
    </p>
    <p>
      XV.
    </p>
    <p>
      THERE is in Shakespeare the mingling of laughter and tears, humor and
      pathos. Humor is the rose, wit the thorn. Wit is a crystallization, humor
      an efflorescence. Wit comes from the brain, humor from the heart. Wit is
      the lightning of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Shakespeare's nature was the climate of humor. He saw and felt the
      sunny side even of the saddest things. You have seen sunshine and rain at
      once. So Shakespeare's tears fell oft upon his smiles. In moments of peril&mdash;on
      the very darkness of death&mdash;there comes a touch of humor that falls
      like a fleck of sunshine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gonzalo, when the ship is about to sink, having seen the boatswain,
      exclaims:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I have great comfort from this fellow;
     Methinks he hath no drowning mark upon him;
     His complexion is perfect gallows."
</pre>
    <p>
      Shakespeare is filled with the strange contrasts of grief and laughter.
      While poor Hero is supposed to be dead&mdash;wrapped in the shroud of
      dishonor&mdash;Dogberry and Verges unconsciously put again the wedding
      wreath upon her pure brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soliloquy of Launcelot&mdash;great as Hamlet's&mdash;offsets the
      bitter and burning words of Shylock.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is only time to speak of Maria in "Twelfth Night," of Autolycus in
      the "Winter's Tale," of the parallel drawn by Fluellen between Alexander
      of Macedon and Harry of Monmouth, or of the marvelous humor of Falstaff,
      who never had the faintest thought of right or wrong&mdash;or of Mercutio,
      that embodiment of wit and humor&mdash;or of the gravediggers who lamented
      that "great folk should have countenance in this world to drown and hang
      themselves, more than their even Christian," and who reached the
      generalization that "the gallows does well because it does well to those
      who do ill."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also an example of grim humor&mdash;an example without a parallel
      in literature, so far as I know. Hamlet having killed Polonius is asked:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Where's Polonius?"

     "At supper."

     "At supper! where?"

     "Not where he eats, but where he is eaten."
</pre>
    <p>
      Above all others, Shakespeare appreciated the pathos of situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is more pathetic than the last scene in "Lear." No one has ever
      bent above his dead who did not feel the words uttered by the mad king,&mdash;words
      born of a despair deeper than tears:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Oh, that a horse, a dog, a rat hath life
     And thou no breath!"
</pre>
    <p>
      So Iago, after he has been wounded, says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I bleed, sir; but not killed."
</pre>
    <p>
      And Othello answers from the wreck and shattered remnant of his life:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I would have thee live;
     For in my sense it is happiness to die."
</pre>
    <p>
      When Troilus finds Cressida has been false, he cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Let it not be believed for womanhood;
     Think! we had mothers."
</pre>
    <p>
      Ophelia, in her madness, "<i>the sweet bells jangled out o' tune,</i>"
      says softly:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I would give you some violets;
     But they withered all when my father died."
</pre>
    <p>
      When Macbeth has reaped the harvest, the seeds of which were sown by his
      murderous hand, he exclaims,&mdash;and what could be more pitiful?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I 'gin to be aweary of the sun."
</pre>
    <p>
      Richard the Second feels how small a thing it is to be, or to have been, a
      king, or to receive honors before or after power is lost; and so, of those
      who stood uncovered before him, he asks this piteous question:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I live with bread, like you; feel want,
     Taste grief, need friends; subjected thus,
     How can you say to me I am a king?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Think of the salutation of Antony to the dead C&aelig;sar:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Pardon me, thou piece of bleeding earth."
</pre>
    <p>
      When Pisanio informs Imogen that he had been ordered by Posthumus to
      murder her, she bares her neck and cries:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "The lamb entreats the butcher:
     Where is thy knife? Thou art too slow
     To do thy master's bidding when I desire it."
</pre>
    <p>
      Antony, as the last drops are falling from his self-inflicted wound,
      utters with his dying breath to Cleopatra, this:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "I here importune death awhile, until
     Of many thousand kisses the poor last
     I lay upon thy lips."
</pre>
    <p>
      To me, the last words of Hamlet are full of pathos:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
          "I die, Horatio.
     The potent poison quite o' er crows my spirit...
     The rest is silence."
</pre>
    <p>
      XVI.
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME have insisted that Shakespeare must have been a physician, for the
      reason that he shows such knowledge of medicine&mdash;of the symptoms of
      disease and death&mdash;was so familiar with the brain, and with insanity
      in all its forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not think he was a physician. He knew too much&mdash;his
      generalizations were too splendid. He had none of the prejudices of that
      profession in his time. We might as well say that he was a musician, a
      composer, because we find in "The Two Gentlemen of Verona" nearly every
      musical term known in Shakespeare's time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Others maintain that he was a lawyer, perfectly acquainted with the forms,
      with the expressions familiar to that profession&mdash;yet there is
      nothing to show that he was a lawyer, or that he knew more about law than
      any intelligent man should know.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not a lawyer. His sense of justice was never dulled by reading
      English law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some think that he was a botanist, because he named nearly all known
      plants. Others, that he was an astronomer, a naturalist, because he gave
      hints and suggestions of nearly all discoveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some have thought that he must have been a sailor, for the reason that the
      orders given in the opening of "The Tempest" were the best that could,
      under the circumstances, have been given to save the ship.
    </p>
    <p>
      For my part, I think there is nothing in the plays to show that he was a
      lawyer, doctor, botanist or scientist. He had the observant eyes that
      really see, the ears that really hear, the brain that retains all
      pictures, all thoughts, logic as unerring as light,-the imagination that
      supplies defects and builds the perfect from a fragment. And these
      faculties, these aptitudes, working together, account for what he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      He exceeded all the sons of men in the splendor of his imagination. To him
      the whole world paid tribute, and nature poured her treasures at his feet.
      In him all races lived again, and even those to be were pictured in his
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a man of imagination&mdash;that is to say, of genius, and having
      seen a leaf, and a drop of water, he could construct the forests, the
      rivers, and the seas&mdash;and in his presence all the cataracts would
      fall and foam, the mists rise, the clouds form and float.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Shakespeare knew one fact, he knew its kindred and its neighbors.
      Looking at a coat of mail, he instantly imagined the society, the
      conditions, that produced it and what it, in turn, produced. He saw the
      castle, the moat, the draw-bridge, the lady in the tower, and the knightly
      lover spurring across the plain. He saw the bold baron and the rude
      retainer, the trampled serf, and all the glory and the grief of feudal
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived the life of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a citizen of Athens in the days of Pericles. He listened to the
      eager eloquence of the great orators, and sat upon the cliffs, and with
      the tragic poet heard "the multitudinous laughter of the sea." He saw
      Socrates thrust the spear of question through the shield and heart of
      falsehood. He was present when the great man drank hemlock, and met the
      night of death, tranquil as a star meets morning. He listened to the
      peripatetic philosophers, and was unpuzzled by the sophists. He watched
      Phidias as he chiseled shapeless stone to forms of love and awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived by the mysterious Nile, amid the vast and monstrous. He knew the
      very thought that wrought the form and features of the Sphinx. He heard
      great Memnon's morning song when marble lips were smitten by the sun. He
      laid him down with the embalmed and waiting dead, and felt within their
      dust the expectation of another life, mingled with cold and suffocating
      doubts&mdash;the children born of long delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked the ways of mighty Rome, and saw great C&aelig;sar with his
      legions in the field. He stood with vast and motley throngs and watched
      the triumphs given to victorious men, followed by uncrowned kings, the
      captured hosts, and all the spoils of ruthless war. He heard the shout
      that shook the Coliseum's roofless walls, when from the reeling
      gladiator's hand the short sword fell, while from his bosom gushed the
      stream of wasted life.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived the life of savage men. He trod the forests' silent depths, and
      in the desperate game of life or death he matched his thought against the
      instinct of the beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew all crimes and all regrets, all virtues and their rich rewards. He
      was victim and victor, pursuer and pursued, outcast and king. He heard the
      applause and curses of the world, and on his heart had fallen all the
      nights and noons of failure and success.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew the unspoken thoughts, the dumb desires, the wants and ways of
      beasts. He felt the crouching tiger's thrill, the terror of the ambushed
      prey, and with the eagles he had shared the ecstasy of flight and poise
      and swoop, and he had lain with sluggish serpents on the barren rocks
      uncoiling slowly in the heat of noon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat beneath the bo-tree's contemplative shade, wrapped in Buddha's
      mighty thought, and dreamed all dreams that light, the alchemist, has
      wrought from dust and dew, and stored within the slumbrous poppy's subtle
      blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knelt with awe and dread at every shrine&mdash;he offered every
      sacrifice, and every prayer&mdash;felt the consolation and the shuddering
      fear&mdash;mocked and worshiped all the gods&mdash;enjoyed all heavens,
      and felt the pangs of every hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived all lives, and through his blood and brain there crept the shadow
      and the chill of every death, and his soul, like Mazeppa, was lashed naked
      to the wild horse of every fear and love and hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Imagination had a stage in. Shakespeare's brain, whereon were set all
      scenes that lie between the morn of laughter and the night of tears, and
      where his players bodied forth the false and true, the joys and griefs,
      the careless shallows and the tragic deeps of universal life.
    </p>
    <p>
      From Shakespeare's brain there poured a Niagara of gems spanned by Fancy's
      seven-hued arch. He was as many-sided as clouds are many-formed. To him
      giving was hoarding&mdash;sowing was harvest&mdash;and waste itself the
      source of wealth. Within his marvelous mind were the fruits of all thought
      past, the seeds of all to be. As a drop of dew contains the image of the
      earth and sky, so all there is of life was mirrored forth in Shakespeare's
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shakespeare was an intellectual ocean, whose waves touched all the shores
      of thought; within which were all the tides and waves of destiny and will;
      over which swept all the storms of fate, ambition and revenge; upon which
      fell the gloom and darkness of despair and death and all the sunlight of
      content and love, and within which was the inverted sky lit with the
      eternal stars&mdash;an intellectual ocean&mdash;towards which all rivers
      ran, and from which now the isles and continents of thought receive their
      dew and rain.

    <p>
      WE have met to-night to honor the memory of that has ever written in our
      language. I would place one above him, and only one&mdash;Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be well enough at the beginning to inquire, What is a poet? What is
      poetry?
    </p>
    <p>
      Every one has some idea of the poetic, and this idea is born of his
      experience&mdash;of his education&mdash;of his surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      There have been more nations than poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many people suppose that poetry is a kind of art depending upon certain
      rules, and that it is only necessary to find out these rules to be a poet.
      But these rules have never been found. The great poet follows them
      unconsciously. The great poet seems as unconscious as Nature, and the
      product of the highest art seems to have been felt instead of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The finest definition perhaps that has been given is this: a poet&mdash;possibly
      the next to the greatest.
    </p>
    <p>
      "As nature unconsciously produces that which appears to be the result of
      consciousness, so the greatest artist consciously produces that which
      appears the unconscious result."
    </p>
    <p>
      Poetry must rest on the experience of men&mdash;the history of heart and
      brain. It must sit by the fireside of the heart. It must have to do with
      this world, with the place in which we live, with the men and women we
      know, with their loves, their hopes, their fears and their joys.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, we care nothing about gods and goddesses, or folks with wings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloud-compelling Jupiters, the ox-eyed Junos, the feather-heeled
      Mercurys, or the Minervas that leaped full-armed from the thick skull of
      some imaginary god, are nothing to us. We know nothing of their fears or
      loves, and for that reason, the poetry that deals with them, no matter how
      ingenious it may be, can never touch the human heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was taught that Milton was a wonderful poet, and above all others
      sublime. I have read Milton once. Few have read him twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      With splendid words, with magnificent mythological imagery, he musters the
      heavenly militia&mdash;puts epaulets on the shoulders of God, and
      describes the Devil as an artillery officer of the highest rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he describes the battles in which immortals undertake the impossible
      task of killing each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take this line:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Flying with indefatigable wings over the vast abrupt."
</pre>
    <p>
      This is called sublime, but what does it mean?
    </p>
    <p>
      We have been taught that Dante was a wonderful poet.
    </p>
    <p>
      He described with infinite minuteness the pangs and agonies endured by the
      damned in the torture&mdash;dungeons of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vicious twins of superstition&mdash;malignity and solemnity&mdash;struggle
      for the mastery in his revengeful lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was one good thing about Dante: he had the courage, and what
      might be called the religious democracy, to see a pope in hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      That is something to be thankful for.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the sonnets of Petrarch are as unmeaning as the promises of
      candidates. They are filled not with genuine passion, but with the
      feelings that lovers are supposed to have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poetry cannot be written by rule; it is nota trade, or a profession. Let
      the critics lay down the laws, and the true poet will violate them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      By rule you can make skeletons, but you cannot clothe them with flesh, put
      blood in their veins, thoughts in their eyes, and passions in their
      hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      This can be done only by following the impulses of the heart, the winged
      fancies of the brain&mdash;by wandering from paths and roads, keeping step
      with the rhythmic ebb and flow of the throbbing blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the olden time in Scotland, most of the so-called poetry was written by
      pedagogues and parsons&mdash;gentlemen who found out what little they knew
      of the living world by reading the dead languages&mdash;by studying
      epitaphs in the cemeteries of literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      They knew nothing of any life that they thought poetic. They kept as far
      from the common people as they could. They wrote countless verses, but no
      poems. They tried to put metaphysics, that is to say, Calvinism, in
      poetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, a Calvinist cannot be a poet. Calvinism takes all the
      poetry out of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the existence of the Calvinistic, the Christian, hell could be
      demonstrated, another poem never could be written. .
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days they made poetry about geography, and the beauties of the
      Scotch Kirk, and even about law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The critics have always been looking for mistakes, not beauties&mdash;not
      for the perfection of expression and feeling. They would object to the
      lark and nightingale because they do not sing by note&mdash;to the clouds
      because they are not square.
    </p>
    <p>
      At one time it was thought that scenery, the grand in nature, made the
      poet. We now know that the poet makes the scenery. Holland has produced
      far more genius than the Alps. Where nature is prodigal&mdash;where the
      crags tower above the clouds&mdash;man is overcome, or overawed. In
      England and Scotland the hills are low, and there is nothing in the
      scenery calculated to rouse poetic blood, and yet these countries have
      produced the greatest literature of all time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that poets and heroes make the scenery. The place where man
      has died for man is grander than all the snow-crowned summits of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A poem is something like a mountain stream that flashes in light, then
      lost in shadow, leaps with a kind of wild joy into the abyss, emerges
      victorious, and winding runs amid meadows, lingers in quiet places,
      holding within its breast the hills and vales and clouds&mdash;then
      running by the cottage door, babbling of joy, and murmuring delight, then
      sweeping on to join its old mother, the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands, millions of men live poems, but do not write them; but every
      great poem has been lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      I say to-night that every good and self-denying man, every one who lives
      and labors for those he loves, for wife and child, is living a poem. The
      loving mother rocking a cradle, singing the slumber song, lives a poem
      pure and tender as the dawn; the man who bares his breast to shot and
      shell lives a poem, and all the great men of the world, and all the brave
      and loving women have been poets in action, whether they have written one
      word or not. The poor woman of the tenement, sewing, blinded by tears,
      lives a poem holier, it may be, than the fortunate can know. The pioneers&mdash;the
      home builders, the heroes of toil, are all poets, and their deeds are
      filled with the pathos and perfection of the highest art.
    </p>
    <p>
      But to-night we are going to talk of a poet&mdash;one who poured out his
      soul in song. How does a country become great? By producing great poets.
      Why is it that Scotland, when the roll of nations is called, can stand up
      and proudly answer "here"? Because Robert Burns has lived. It is Robert
      Burns that put Scotland in the front rank.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 25th of January, 1759, Robert Burns was born. William Burns, a
      gardener, his father; Agnes Brown, his mother. He was born near the little
      town of Ayr, in a little cottage made of mud and thatched with straw. From
      the first, poverty was his portion,&mdash;"Poverty, the half-sister of
      Death." The father struggled as best he could, but at last overcome more
      by misfortunes than by disease, died in 1784, at the age of 63. Robert
      attended school at Alloway Mill, and had been taught a little by John
      Murdock, and some by his father. That was his education&mdash;with this
      exception, that whenever nature produces a genius, the old mother holds
      him close to her heart and whispers secrets to his ears that others do not
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had spent most of his time working on a farm, raising very poor crops,
      getting deeper and deeper into debt, until finally the death of his father
      left him to struggle as best he might for himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the year 1759, Scotland was emerging from the darkness and gloom of
      Calvinism. The attention of the people had been drawn from the other
      world, or rather from the other worlds, to the affairs of this. The
      commercial spirit, the interests of trade, were winning men from the
      discussion of predestination and the sacred decrees of God. Mechanics and
      manufacturers were undermining theology. The influence of the clergy was
      gradually diminishing, and the beggarly elements of this life were
      beginning to attract the attention of the Scotch. The people at that time
      were mostly poor. They had made but little progress in art and science.
      They had been engaged for many years fighting for their political or
      theological rights, or to destroy the rights of others. They had great
      energy, great natural sense, and courage without limit, and it may be well
      enough to add that they were as obstinate as brave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Several countries have had a metaphysical peasantry. It is true of parts
      of Switzerland about the time of Calvin. In Holland, after the people had
      suffered all the cruelties that Spain could inflict, they began to discuss
      as to foreordination and free will, and upon these questions destroyed
      each other. The same is true of New England, and peculiarly true of
      Scotland&mdash;a metaphysical peasantry&mdash;men who lived in mud houses
      thatched with straw and discussed the motives of God and the means by
      which the Infinite Being was to accomplish his ends.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years the Scotch had been ruled by the clergy. The power of the
      Scotch preacher was unlimited. It so happened that the religion of
      Scotland became synonymous with patriotism, and those who were fighting
      Scotland were also fighting her religion. This drew priest and people
      together; and the priest naturally took advantage of the situation. They
      not only determined upon the policy to be pursued by the people, but they
      went into every detail of life. And in this world there has never been
      established a more odious tyranny or a more odious form of government than
      that of the Scotch Kirk.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few men had made themselves famous&mdash;David Hume, Adam Smith, Doctor
      Hugh Blair, he of the grave, Beattie and Ramsay, Reid and Robertson&mdash;but
      the great body of the people were orthodox to the last drop of their
      blood. Nothing seemed to please them like attending church, like hearing
      sermons. Before Communion Sabbath they frequently met on Friday, having
      two or three sermons on that day, three or four on Saturday, more if
      possible on Sunday, and wound up with a kind of gospel spree on Monday.
      They loved it. I think it was Heinrich Heine who said, "It is not true, it
      is not true that the damned in hell are compelled to hear all the sermons
      preached on earth." He says this is not true. This shows that there is
      some mercy even in hell. They were infinitely interested in these
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, the people were social, fond of games, of outdoor sports, full of
      song and story, and no folks ever passed the cup with a happier smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes I have thought that they were saved from the gloom of Calvinism
      by the use of intoxicating liquors. It may be that John Barleycorn
      redeemed the Scotch and saved them from the divine dyspepsia of the
      Calvinistic creed. So, too, it may be that the Puritan was saved by rum,
      and the Hollander by schnapps. Yet, in spite of the gloom of the creed, in
      spite of the climate of mists and fogs, and the maniac winters, the songs
      of Scotland are the sweetest and the tenderest in all the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Burns was a peasant&mdash;a ploughman&mdash;a poet. Why is it that
      millions and millions of men and women love this man? He was a Scotchman,
      and all the tendrils of his heart struck deep in Scotland's soil. He
      voiced the ideals of the best and greatest of his race and blood. And yet
      he is as dear to the citizens of this great Republic as to Scotia's sons
      and daughters.
    </p>
    <p>
      All great poetry has a national flavor. It tastes of the soil. No matter
      how great it is, how wide, how universal, the flavor of locality is never
      lost. Burns made common life beautiful. He idealized the sun-burnt girls
      who worked in the fields. He put honest labor above titled idleness. He
      made a cottage far more poetic than a palace. He painted the simple joys
      and ecstasies and raptures of sincere love. He put native sense above the
      polish of schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      We love him because he was independent, sturdy, self-poised, social,
      generous, susceptible, thrilled by a look, by a touch, full of pity,
      carrying the sorrows of others in his heart, even those of animals; hating
      to see anybody suffer, and lamenting the death of everything&mdash;even of
      trees and flowers. We love him because he was a natural democrat, and
      hated tyranny in every form.
    </p>
    <p>
      We love him because he was always on the side of the people, feeling the
      throb of progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns read but little, had but few books; had but a little of what is
      called education; had only an outline of history, a little of philosophy,
      in its highest sense. His library consisted of the <i>Life of Hannibal</i>,
      the <i>History of Wallace</i>, Ray's <i>Wisdom of God</i>, Stackhouse's <i>History
      of the Bible</i>; two or three plays of Shakespeare, Ferguson's <i>Scottish
      Poems</i>, Pope's <i>Homer</i>, Shenstone, McKenzie's <i>Man of Feeling</i>
      and Ossian.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns was a man of genius. He was like a spring&mdash;something that
      suggests no labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A spring seems to be a perpetual free gift of nature. There is no thought
      of toil. The water comes whispering to the pebbles without effort. There
      is no machinery, no pipes, no pumps, no engines, no water-works, nothing
      that suggests expense or trouble. So a natural poet is, when compared with
      the educated, with the polished, with the industrious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns seems to have done everything without effort. His poems wrote
      themselves. He was overflowing with sympathies, with suggestions, with
      ideas, in every possible direction. There is no midnight oil. There is
      nothing of the student&mdash;no suggestion of their having been re-written
      or re-cast. There is in his heart a poetic April and May, and all the
      poetic seeds burst into sudden life. In a moment the seed is a plant, and
      the plant is in blossom, and the fruit is given to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looks at everything from a natural point of view; and he writes of the
      men and women with whom he was acquainted. He cares nothing for mythology,
      nothing for the legends of the Greeks and Romans. He draws but little from
      history. Everything that he uses is within his reach, and he knows it from
      centre to circumference. All his figures and comparisons are perfectly
      natural. He does not endeavor to make angels of fine ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      He takes the servant girls with whom he is acquainted, the dairy maids
      that he knows. He puts wings upon them and makes the very angels envious.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet this man, so natural, keeping his cheek so close to the breast of
      nature, strangely enough thought that Pope and Churchill and Shenstone and
      Thomson and Lyttelton and Beattie were great poets.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first poem was addressed to Nellie Kilpatrick, daughter of the
      blacksmith. He was in love with Ellison Begbie, offered her his heart and
      was refused. She was a servant, working in a family and living on the
      banks of the Cessnock. Jean Armour, his wife, was the daughter of a
      tailor, and Highland Mary, a servant&mdash;a milk-maid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not make women of goddesses, but he made goddesses of women.
    </p>
    <p>
      POET OF LOVE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns was the poet of love. To him woman was divine. In the light of her
      eyes he stood transfigured. Love changed this peasant to a king; the plaid
      became a robe of purple; the ploughman became a poet; the poor laborer an
      inspired lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his "Vision" his native Muse tells the story of his verse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "When youthful Love, warm-blushing strong,
     Keen-shivering shot thy nerves along,
     Those accents, grateful to thy tongue,
     Th' adored Name,
     I taught thee how to pour in song,
     To soothe thy flame."
</pre>
    <p>
      Ah, this light from heaven: how it has purified the heart of man!
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there ever a sweeter song than "Bonnie Doon"?
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Thou'lt break my heart thou bonnie bird
     That sings beside thy mate,
     For sae I sat and sae I sang,
     And wist na o' my fate."
</pre>
    <p>
      or,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "O, my luve's like a red, red rose
     That's newly sprung in June;
     O, my luve's like the melodie
     That's sweetly play'd in tune."
</pre>
    <p>
      It would consume days to give the intense and tender lines&mdash;lines wet
      with the heart's blood, lines that throb and sigh and weep, lines that
      glow like flames, lines that seem to clasp and kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the most perfect love-poem that I know&mdash;pure the tear of
      gratitude&mdash;is "To Mary in Heaven:"
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Thou lingering star, with less'ning ray,
     That lov'st to greet the early morn,
     Again thou usher'st in the day
     My Mary from my soul was torn.
     O Mary! dear departed shade!
     Where is thy place of blissful rest?
     Seest thou thy lover lowly laid?
     Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?

     "That sacred hour can I forget?
     Can I forget the hallow'd grove
     Where, by the winding Ayr, we met,
     To live one day of parting love?
     Eternity will not efface
     Those records dear of transports past;
     Thy image at our last embrace;
     Ah! little thought we 'twas our last!

     "Ayr, gurgling, kiss'd his pebbled shore,
     O'erhung with wild woods, thick'ning green;
     The fragrant birch, and hawthorn hoar,
     Twin'd am'rous round the raptur'd scene.
     The flowers sprang wanton to be prest,
     The birds sang love on ev'ry spray,
     Till too, too soon, the glowing west
     Proclaim'd the speed of wing&egrave;d day.

     "Still o'er these scenes my mem'ry wakes,
     And fondly broods with miser care!
     Time but the impression stronger makes,
     As streams their channels deeper wear.
     My Mary, dear departed shade!
     Where is thy blissful place of rest?
     Seest thou thy lover lowly laid?
     Hear'st thou the groans that rend his breast?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Above all the daughters of luxury and wealth, above all of Scotland's
      queens rises this pure and gentle girl made deathless by the love of
      Robert Burns.
    </p>
    <p>
      POET OF HOME
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the poet of the home&mdash;of father, mother, child&mdash;of the
      purest wedded love.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the "Cotter's Saturday Night," one of the noblest and sweetest poems in
      the literature of the world, is a description of the poor cotter going
      from his labor to his home:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "At length his lonely cot appears in view,
     Beneath the shelter of an aged tree;
     Th' expectant wee-things, toddlin', stacher through
     To meet their Dad, wi' flichterin' noise and glee.

     His wee bit ingle, blinkin' bonnilie,
     His clean hearth-stane, his thrifty wifie's smile,
     The lisping infant prattling on his knee,
     Does a' his weary carking cares beguile,
     And makes him quite forget his labour an' his toil."
</pre>
    <p>
      And in the same poem, after having described the courtship, Burns bursts
      into this perfect flower:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "O happy love! where love like this is found!
     O heart-felt raptures! bliss beyond compare!
     I've pac&egrave;d much this weary, mortal round,
     And sage experience bids me this declare:
     If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare
     One cordial in this melancholy vale,
     'Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair,
     In other's arms, breathe out the tender tale
     Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the ev'ning gale."
</pre>
    <p>
      Is there in the world a more beautiful&mdash;a more touching picture than
      the old couple sitting by the ingleside with clasped hands, and the pure,
      patient, loving old wife saying to the white-haired man who won her heart
      when the world was young:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "John Anderson, my jo, John,
     When we were first acquent;
     Your locks were like the raven,
     Your bonnie brow was brent;
     But now your brow is beld, John,
     Your locks are like the snaw;
     But blessings on your frosty pow,
     John Anderson, my jo.

     "John Anderson, my jo, John,
     We clamb the hill thegither;
     And monie a canty day, John,
     We've had wi' ane anither;
     Now we maun totter down, John,
     But hand in hand we'll go,
     And sleep thegither at the foot,
     John Anderson, my jo."

      Burns taught that the love of wife and children was the highest&mdash;that
      to toil for them was the noblest.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "The sacred lowe o' weel placed love,
     Luxuriantly indulge it;
     But never tempt the illicit rove,
     Though naething should divulge it."

     "I waine the quantum of the sin,
     The hazzard o'concealing;
     But och! it hardens all within,
     And petrifies the feeling."

     "To make a happy fireside clime
     To weans and wife,
     That's the true pathos, and sublime,
     Of human life."

      FRIENDSHIP.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the poet of friendship:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
     And never brought to min'?
     Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
     And days o' auld lang syne?"

      SCOTCH DRINK.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poet of good Scotch drink, of merry meetings, of the cup that cheers,
      author of the best drinking song in the world:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "O, Willie brew'd a peck o' maut,
     And Rob and Allen came to see;
     Three blyther hearts, that lee-lang night,

     Chorus.

     "We are na fou, we're no that fou,

     The cock may craw, the day may daw,
     And aye we'll taste the barley bree.

      POETS BORN, NOT MADE.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not think the poet could be made&mdash;that colleges could furnish
      feeling, capacity, genius. He gave his opinion of these manufactured
      minstrels:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "A set o' dull, conceited hashes,
     Confuse their brains in college classes!
     They gang in stirks, and come out asses,
     Plain truth to speak;
     An' syne they think to climb Parnassus
     By dint o' Greek!"

     "Gie me ane spark o' Nature's fire,
     That's a' the learning I desire;
     Then tho' I drudge thro' dub an' mire
     At pleugh or cart,
     My Muse, though hamely in attire,
     May touch the heart."

      BURNS, THE ARTIST.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an artist&mdash;a painter of pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      This of the brook:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Whyles owre a linn the burnie plays,

     Whyles round a rocky scaur it strays;
     Whyles in a wiel it dimpl't;
     Whyles glitter's to the nightly rays,
     Wi' bickering, dancing dazzle;
     Whyles cookit underneath the braes,
     Below the spreading hazel,
     Unseen that night."

      Or this from Tam O'Shanter:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "But pleasures are like poppies spread,
     You seize the flow'r, its bloom is shed,
     Or, like the snow falls in the river,
     A moment white&mdash;then melts forever;
     Or, like the borealis race,
     That flit ere you can point their place;
     Or, like the rainbow's lovely form,
     Evanishing amid the storm."
</pre>
    <p>
      This:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "As in the bosom of the stream

      A REAL DEMOCRAT.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in every fibre of his being a sincere democrat. He was a believer
      in the people&mdash;in the sacred rights of man. He believed that honest
      peasants were superior to titled parasites. He knew the so-called "gentrv"
      of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      In one of his letters to Dr. Moore is this passage: "It takes a few dashes
      into the world to give the young great man that proper, decent, unnoticing
      disregard for the poor, insignificant, stupid devils&mdash;the mechanics
      and peasantry around him&mdash;who were born in the same village."
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew the infinitely cruel spirit of caste&mdash;a spirit that despises
      the useful&mdash;the children of toil&mdash;those who bear the burdens of
      the world.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "If I'm design'd yon lordling's slave,
     By nature's law design'd,
     Why was an independent wish
     E'er planted in my mind?

     If not, why am I subject to .
     His cruelty, or scorn?
     Or why has man the will and pow'r
     To make his fellow mourn?"
</pre>
    <p>
      Against the political injustice of his time&mdash;against the artificial
      distinctions among men by which the lowest were regarded as the highest&mdash;he
      protested in the great poem, "A man's a man for a' that," every line of
      which came like lava from his heart.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Is there, for honest poverty,
     That hangs his head, and a' that?
     The coward-slave, we pass him by,
     We dare be poor for a' that!
     For a' that, and a' that,
     Our toils obscure, and a' that;
     The rank is but the guinea stamp;
     The man's the gowd for a' that."

     "What tho' on hamely fare we dine,
     Wear hodden-gray, and a' that;
     Gie fools their silks, and knaves their wine,

     "Ye see yon birkie, ca'd a lord,
     Wha struts, and stares, and a' that;
     Tho' hundreds worship at his word,
     He's but a coof for a' that;
     For a' that, and a' that,
     His riband, star, and a' that,
     The man' o' independent mind,

     "A prince can mak' a belted knight,

     Guid faith he mauna fa' that!
     For a' that, and a' that,

     The pith o' sense, and pride o' worth,
     Are higher ranks than a' that.

     "Then let us pray that come it may,
     As come it will for a' that;
     That sense and worth, o'er a' the earth,
     May bear the gree and a' that.
     For a' that, and a' that;
     It's cornin' yet for a' that

    <p>
      No grander declaration of independence was ever uttered. It stirs the
      blood like a declaration of war. It is the apotheosis of honesty,
      independence, sense and worth. And it is a prophecy of that better day
      when men will be brothers the world over.

    <p>
      HIS THEOLOGY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns was superior in heart and brain to the theologians of his time. He
      knew that the creed of Calvin was infinitely cruel and absurd, and he
      attacked it with every weapon that his brain could forge.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not awed by the clergy, and he cared nothing for what was called
      "authority." He insisted on thinking for himself. Sometimes he faltered,
      and now and then, fearing that some friend might take offence, he would
      say or write a word in favor of the Bible, and sometimes he praised the
      Scriptures in words of scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed at the dogma of eternal pain&mdash;at hell as described by the
      preacher:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "A vast, unbottom'd, boundless pit,
     Fill'd fou o' lowin' brunstane,
     Wha's ragin' flame an' scorchin' heat
     Wad melt the hardest whun-stane!
     The half asleep start up wi' fear,
     An' think they hear it roarin',
     When presently it does appear,
     'Twas but some neebor snorin'.
     Asleep that day."
</pre>
    <p>
      The dear old doctrine that man is totally depraved, that morality is a
      snare&mdash;a flowery path leading to perdition&mdash;excited the
      indignation of Burns. He put the doctrine in verse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "Morality, thou deadly bane,
     Thy tens o' thousands thou hast slain!
     Vain is his hope, whose stay and trust is
     In moral mercy, truth and justice."
     He understood the hypocrites of his day:
     "Hypocrisy, in mercy spare it!
     That holy robe, O dinna tear it!
     Spare't for their sakes wha aften wear it,
     The lads in black;
     But your curst wit, when it comes near it,
     Rives't aff their back."

     "Then orthodoxy yet may prance,
     And Learning in a woody dance,
     And that fell cur ca'd Common Sense,
     That bites sae sair,
     Be banish'd owre the seas to France;
     Let him bark there."

     "They talk religion in their mouth;
     They talk o' mercy, grace, an' truth,
     For what? to gie their malice skouth On some puir wight,
     An' hunt him down, o'er right an' ruth,
     To ruin straight."

     "Doctor Mac, Doctor Mac,
     Ye should stretch on a rack,
     To strike evil doers wi' terror;
     To join faith and sense Upon any pretence,
     Was heretic damnable error,
     Doctor Mac,
     Was heretic damnable error."
</pre>
    <p>
      But the greatest, the sharpest, the deadliest, the keenest, the wittiest
      thing ever said or written against Calvinism is Holy Willie's Prayer:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "O Thou, wha in the Heavens dost dwell,
     Wha, as it pleases best thysel',
     Sends ane to heaven and ten to hell,
     A' for thy glory,
     And no for onie guid or ill
     They've done afore thee!

     "I bless and praise thy matchless might,
     When thousands thou has left in night,
     That I am here afore thy sight
     For gifts an' grace,
     A burnin' an' a shinin' light,
     To a' this place.

     "What was I, or my generation,
     That I should get sic exaltation?
     I, wha deserve sic just damnation,
     For broken laws,
     Five thousand years 'fore my creation,
     Thro' Adam's cause?

     "When frae my mither's womb I fell,
     Thou might hae plunged me into hell,
     To gnash my gums, to weep and wail,
     In burnin' lake,
     Where damn&egrave;d devils roar and yell,
     Chained to a stake.

     "Yet I am here a chosen sample,
     To show Thy grace is great and ample;
     I'm here a pillar in Thy temple,
     Strong as a rock,
     A guide, a buckler, an example
     To a' Thy flock."
</pre>
    <p>
      In this poem you will find the creed stated just as it is&mdash;with
      fairness and accuracy&mdash;and at the same time stated so perfectly that
      its absurdity fills the mind with inextinguishable laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this poem Burns nailed Calvinism to the cross, put it on the rack,
      subjected it to every instrument of torture, flayed it alive, burned it at
      the stake, and scattered its ashes to the winds.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1787 Burns wrote this curious letter to Miss Chalmers:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have taken tooth and nail to the Bible, and have got through the five
      books of Moses and half way in Joshua.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is really a glorious book."
    </p>
    <p>
      This must have been written in the spirit of Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of Burns, with his loving, tender heart, half way in Joshua,
      standing in blood to his knees, surrounded by the mangled bodies of old
      men, women and babes, the swords of the victors dripping with innocent
      blood, shouting&mdash;"This is really a glorious sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      A letter written on the seventh of March, 1788, contains the clearest,
      broadest and most philosophical statement of the religion of Burns to be
      found in his works:
    </p>
    <p>
      "An honest man has nothing to fear. If we lie down in the grave, the whole
      man a piece of broken machinery, to moulder with the clods of the valley&mdash;be
      it so; at least there is an end of pain and care, woes and wants. If that
      part of us called Mind does survive the apparent destruction of the man,
      away with old-wife prejudices and tales!
    </p>
    <p>
      "Every age and every nation has a different set of stories; and, as the
      many are always weak, of consequence they have often, perhaps always, been
      deceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      "A man conscious of having acted an honest part among his fellow
      creatures, even granting that he may have been the sport at times of
      passions and instincts, he goes to a great Unknown Being, who could have
      had no other end in giving him existence but to make him happy; who gave
      him those passions and instincts and well knows their force.
    </p>
    <p>
      "These, my worthy friend, are my ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      "It becomes a man of sense to think for himself, particularly in a case
      where all men are equally interested, and where, indeed, all men are
      equally in the dark."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Religious nonsense is the most nonsensical nonsense."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Why has a religious turn of mind always a tendency to narrow and harden
      the heart?"
    </p>
    <p>
      "All my fears and cares are for this world."
    </p>
    <p>
      We have grown tired of gods and goddesses in art. Milton's heavenly
      militia excites our laughter. Light-houses have driven sirens from the
      dangerous coasts. We have found that we do not depend on the imagination
      for wonders&mdash;there are millions of miracles under our feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more marvelous than the common and everyday facts of life.
      The phantoms have been cast aside. Men and women are enough for men and
      women. In their lives is all the tragedy and all the comedy that they can
      comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter no longer crowds his canvas with the winged and impossible&mdash;he
      paints life as he sees it, people as he knows them, and in whom he is
      interested. "The Angelus," the perfection of pathos, is nothing but two
      peasants bending their heads in thankfulness as they hear the solemn sound
      of the distant bell&mdash;two peasants, who have nothing to be thankful
      for&mdash;nothing but weariness and want, nothing but the crusts that they
      soften with their tears&mdash;nothing. And yet as you look at that picture
      you feel that they have something besides to be thankful for&mdash;that
      they have life, love, and hope&mdash;and so the distant bell makes music
      in their simple hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me give you the difference between culture and nature&mdash;between
      educated talent and real genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while ago one of the great poets died. I was reading some of his
      volumes and during the same period was reading a little from Robert Burns.
      And the difference between these two poets struck me forcibly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson was a piece of rare china decorated by the highest art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns was made of honest, human clay, moulded by sympathy and love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson dwelt in his fancy, for the most part, with kings and queens,
      with lords and ladies, with knights and nobles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns lingered by the fireside of the poor and humble, in the thatched
      cottage of the peasant, with the imprisoned and despised. He loved men and
      women in spite of their titles, and without regard to the outward. Through
      robes and rags he saw and loved the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson was touched by place and power, the insignia given by chance or
      birth. As he grew old he grew narrower, lost interest in the race, and
      gave his heart to the class to which he had been lowered as a reward for
      melodious flattery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns broadened and ripened with the flight of his few years. His
      sympathies widened and increased to the last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson had the art born of intellectual taste, of the sense of mental
      proportion, knowing the color of adjectives and the gradations of
      emphasis. His pictures were born in his brain, exquisitely shaded by
      details, carefully wrought by painful and conscious art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns's brain was the servant of his heart. His melody was a rhythm taught
      by love. He was touched by the miseries, the injustice, the agony of his
      time. While Tennyson wrote of the past&mdash;of kings long dead, of ladies
      who had been dust for many centuries, Burns melted with his love the walls
      of caste&mdash;the cruel walls that divide the rich and the poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson celebrated the birth of royal babes, the death of the titled
      useless; gave wings to degraded dust, wearing the laurels given by those
      who lived upon the toil of men whom they despised. Burns poured poems from
      his heart, filled with tears and sobs for the suffering poor; poems that
      helped to break the chains of millions; poems that the enfranchised love
      to repeat; poems that liberty loves to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson was the poet of the past, of the twilight, of the sunset, of
      decorous regret, of the vanished glories of barbarous times, of the age of
      chivalry in which great nobles clad in steel smote to death with battle
      axe and sword the unarmed peasants of the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns was the poet of the dawn, glad that the night was fading from the
      east. He kept his face toward the sunrise, caring nothing for the midnight
      of the past, but loved with all the depth and sincerity of his nature the
      few great souls&mdash;the lustrous stars&mdash;that darkness cannot
      quench.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson was surrounded with what gold can give, touched with the
      selfishness of wealth. He was educated at Oxford, and had what are called
      the advantages of his time, and in maturer years was somewhat swayed by
      the spirit of caste, by the descendants of the ancient Pharisees, and at
      last became a lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns had but little knowledge of the world. What he knew was taught him
      by his sympathies. Being a genius, he absorbed the good and noble of which
      he heard or dreamed, and thus he happily outgrew the smaller things with
      which he came in contact, and journeyed toward the great&mdash;the wider
      world, until he reached the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson was what is called religious. He believed in the divinity of
      decorum, not falling on his face before the Eternal King, but bowing
      gracefully, as all lords should, while uttering thanks for favors partly
      undeserved, and thanks more fervid still for those to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns had the deepest and the tenderest feelings in his heart. The winding
      stream, the flowering shrub, the shady vale&mdash;these were trysting
      places where the real God met those he loved, and where his spirit
      prompted thoughts and words of thankfulness and praise, took from their
      hearts the dross of selfishness and hate, leaving the gold of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the religion of Burns, form was nothing, creed was nothing, feeling was
      everything. He had the religious climate of the soul, the April that
      receives the seed, the June of blossom, and the month of harvest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns was a real poet of nature. He put fields and woods in his lines.
      There were principles like oaks, and there were thoughts, hints and
      suggestions as shy as violets beneath the withered leaves. There were the
      warmth of home, the social virtues born of equal state, that touched the
      heart and softened grief; that make breaches in the cruel walls of pride;
      that make the rich and poor clasp hands and feel like comrades, warm and
      true.

      The house in which his spirit lived was not large. It enclosed only space
      enough for common needs, built near the barren land of want; but through
      the open door the sunlight streamed, and from its windows all the stars
      were seen, while in the garden grew the common flowers&mdash;the flowers
      that all the ages through have been the messengers of honest love; and in
      the fields were heard the rustling corn, and reapers songs, telling of
      well-requited toil; and there were trees whose branches rose and fell and
      swayed while birds filled all the air with music born of joy. He read with
      tear-filled eyes the human page, and found within his breast the history
      of hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson's imagination lived in a palace ample, wondrous fair, with dome
      and spire and galleries, where eyes of proud old pedigree grew dim with
      gazing at the portraits of the worthless dead; and there were parks and
      labyrinths of walks and ways and artificial lakes where sailed the "double
      swans;" and there were flowers from far-off lands with strange perfume,
      and men and women of the grander sort, telling of better days and nobler
      deeds than men in these poor times of commerce, trade and toil have hearts
      to do; and, yet, from this fair dwelling&mdash;too vast, too finely
      wrought, to be a home&mdash;he uttered wondrous words, painting pictures
      that will never fade, and told, with every aid of art, old tales of love
      and war, sometimes beguiling men of tears, enchanting all with melody of
      speech, and sometimes rousing blood and planting seeds of high resolve and
      noble deeds; and sometimes thoughts were woven like tapestries in patterns
      beautiful, involved and strange, where dreams and fancies interlaced like
      tendrils of a vine, like harmonies that wander and return to catch the
      music of the central theme, yet cold as traceries in frost wrought on
      glass by winter's subtle art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson was ingenious&mdash;Burns ingenuous. One was exclusive, and in
      his exclusiveness a little disdain. The other pressed the world against
      his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson touched art on many sides, dealing with vast poetic themes, and
      satisfied in many ways the intellectual tastes of cultured men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tennyson is always perfectly self-possessed. He has poetic sympathy, but
      not the fire and flame. No one thinks of him as having been excited, as
      being borne away by passion's storm. His pulse never rises. In artistic
      calm, he turns, polishes, perfects, embroiders and beautifies. In him
      there is nothing of the storm and chaos, nothing of the creative genius,
      no sea wrought to fury, filling the heavens with its shattered cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns dwelt with simple things&mdash;with those that touch the heart; that
      tell of joy; that spring from labor done; that lift the burdens of despair
      from fainting souls; that soften hearts until the pearls of pity fall from
      eyes unused to weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      To illustrate his thought, he used the things he knew&mdash;the things
      familiar to the world&mdash;not caring for the vanished things&mdash;the
      legends told by artful tongues to artless ears&mdash;but clinging to the
      common things of life and love and death, adorning them with countless
      gems; and, over all, he placed the bow of hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      With him the man was greater than the king, the woman than the queen. The
      greatest were the noblest, and the noblest were those who loved their
      fellow-men the best, the ones who filled their lives with generous deeds.
      Men admire Tennyson. Men love Robert Burns.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a believer in God, and had confidence that this God was sitting at
      the loom weaving with warp and woof of cause and effect, of fear and
      fancy, pain and hope, of dream and shadows, of despair and death, mingled
      with the light of love, the tapestries in which at last all souls will see
      that all was perfect from the first. He believed or hoped that the spirit
      of infinite goodness, soft as the autumn air, filled all of heaven's dome
      with love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a religion is easy to understand when it includes all races through
      all times. It is consistent, if not with the highest thought, with the
      deepest and the tenderest feelings of the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      FROM CRADLE TO COFFIN.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no time to follow the steps of Burns from old Alloway, by the
      Bonnie Doon in the clay-built hut, where the January wind blew hansel in
      on Robin&mdash;to Mt. Oliphant, with its cold and stingy soil, the hard
      factor, whose letters made the children weep&mdash;working in the fields,
      or tired with "The thresher's weary flinging tree," where he was thrilled,
      for the first time with love's sweet pain that set his heart to music.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Lochlea, still giving wings to thought&mdash;still working in the
      unproductive fields, Lochlea where his father died, and reached the rest
      that life denied.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Mossgiel, where Burns reached the top and summit of his art and wrote
      like one enrapt, inspired. Here he met and loved and gave to immortality
      his Highland Mary.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Edinburgh and fame, and back to Mauchline to Jean Armour and honor, the
      noblest deed of all his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Ellisland, by the winding Nith.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Dumfries, a poor exciseman, wearing out his heart in the disgusting
      details of degrading drudgery&mdash;suspected of treason because he
      preferred Washington to Pitt&mdash;because he sympathized with the French
      Revolution&mdash;because he was glad that the American colonies had become
      a free nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a banquet once, being asked to drink the health of Pitt, Burns said: "I
      will give you a better toast&mdash;George Washington." A little while
      after, when they wanted him to drink to the success of the English arms,
      Burns said: "No; I will drink this: May their success equal the justice of
      their cause." He sent three or four little cannon to the French
      Convention, because he sympathized with the French Revolution, and because
      of these little things, his love of liberty, of freedom and justice, at
      Dumfries he was suspected of being a traitor, and, as a result of these
      trivial things, as a result of that suspicion, Burns was obliged to join
      the Dumfries volunteers.
    </p>
    <p>
      How pitiful that the author of "Scots wha hae with Wallace bled," should
      be thought an enemy of Scotland!
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Burns! Old and broken before his time&mdash;surrounded by the walking
      lumps of Dumfries' clay!
    </p>
    <p>
      To appease the anger of his fellow-citizens&mdash;to convince them that he
      was a patriot, he actually joined the Dumfries volunteers,&mdash;bought
      his uniform on credit&mdash;amount about seven pounds&mdash;was unable to
      pay&mdash;was threatened with arrest and a jail by Matthew Penn.
    </p>
    <p>
      These threats embittered his last hours.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little while before his death, he said: "Do not let that awkward squad&mdash;the
      Dumfries volunteers&mdash;fire over my grave." We have a true insight into
      what his feelings were. But they fired. They were bound to fire or die.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last words uttered by Robert Burns were these: "That damned scoundrel
      Matthew Penn."
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns had another art, the art of ending&mdash;of stopping at the right
      place. Nothing is more difficult than this. It is hard to end a play&mdash;to
      get the right kind of roof on a house. Not one story-teller in a thousand
      knows just the spot where the rocket should explode. They go on talking
      after the stick has fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Burns wrote short poems, and why? All great poems are short. There cannot
      be a long poem any more than there can be a long joke. I believe the best
      example of an ending perfectly accomplished you will find in his "Vision."
    </p>
    <p>
      There comes into his house, into that "auld clay biggin," his muse, the
      spirit of a beautiful woman, and tells him what he can do, and what he
      can't do, as a poet. He has a long talk with her and now the thing is how
      to get her out of the house. You may think that it is an easy thing. It is
      easy to get yourself into difficulty, but not to get out.
    </p>
    <p>
      I was struck with the beautiful manner in which Burns got that angel out
      of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be happier than the ending of the "Vision"&mdash;the
      leave-taking of the Muse:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     "And wear thou this, she solemn said,
     And bound the holly round my head:
     The polished leaves and berries red
     Did rustling play;
     And, like a passing thought she fled.
     In light away."
</pre>
    <p>
      How that man rose above all his fellows in death! Do you know, there is
      something wonderful in death. What a repose! What a piece of sculpture!
      The common man dead looks royal; a genius dead, sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a few years ago I visited all the places where Burns had been, from
      the little house of clay with one room where he was born, to the little
      house with one room where he now sleeps, I thought of this. Yes, I visited
      them all, all the places made immortal by his genius, the field where love
      first touched his heart, the field where he ploughed up the home of the
      Mouse. I saw the cottage where Robert and Jean first lived as man and
      wife, and walked on "the banks and braes of Bonnie Doon." And when I stood
      by his grave, I said: This man was a radical, a real genuine man. This man
      believed in the dignity of labor, in the nobility of the useful. This man
      believed in human love, in making a heaven here, in judging men by their
      deeds instead of creeds and titles. This man believed in the liberty of
      the soul, of thought and speech. This man believed in the sacred rights of
      the individual; he sympathized with the suffering and oppressed. This man
      had the genius to change suffering and toil into song, to enrich poverty,
      to make a peasant feel like a prince of the blood, to fill the lives of
      the lowly with love and light. This man had the genius to make robes of
      glory out of squalid rags. This man had the genius to make Cleopatras, and
      Sapphos and Helens out of the freckled girls of the villages and fields&mdash;and
      he had the genius to make Auld Ayr, and Bonnie Doon, and Sweet Afton and
      the Winding Nith murmur the name of Robert Burns forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      This man left a legacy of glory to Scotland and the whole world; he
      enriched our language, and with a generous hand scattered the gems of
      thought. This man was the companion of poverty, and wept the tears of
      grief, and yet he has caused millions to shed the happy tears of joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart blossomed in a thousand songs&mdash;songs for all times and all
      seasons&mdash;suited to every experience of the heart&mdash;songs for the
      dawn of love&mdash;for the glance and clasp and kiss of courtship&mdash;for
      "favors secret, sweet and precious"&mdash;for the glow and flame, the
      ecstasy and rapture of wedded life&mdash;songs of parting and despair&mdash;songs
      of hope and simple joy&mdash;songs for the vanished days&mdash;songs for
      birth and burial&mdash;songs for wild war's deadly blast, and songs for
      gentle peace&mdash;songs for the dying and the dead&mdash;songs for labor
      and content&mdash;songs for the spinning wheel, the sickle and the plow&mdash;songs
      for sunshine and for storm, for laughter and for tears&mdash;songs that
      will be sung as long as language lives and passion sways the heart of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when I was at his birth-place, at that little clay house where he was
      born, standing in that sacred place, I wrote these lines:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Though Scotland boasts a thousand names,
     Of patriot, king and peer,
     The noblest, grandest of them all,
     Was loved and cradled here.
     Here lived the gentle peasant-prince,
     The loving cotter-king,
     Compared with whom the greatest lord
     Is but a titled thing.

     'Tis but a cot roofed in with straw,
     A hovel made of clay;
     One door shuts out the snow and storm,
     One window greets the day;
     And yet I stand within this room,
     And hold all thrones in scorn;
     For here beneath this lowly thatch,
     Love's sweetest bard was born.

     Within this hallowed hut I feel
     Like one who clasps a shrine,
     When the glad lips at last have touched
     The something deemed divine.
     And here the world through all the years,
     As long as day returns,
     The tribute of its love and tears,
     Will pay to Robert Burns.

    <h2>
      ABRAHAM LINCOLN
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      ON the 12th of February, 1809, two babes were born&mdash;one in the woods
      of Kentucky, amid the hardships and poverty of pioneers; one in England,
      surrounded by wealth and culture. One was educated in the University of
      Nature, the other at Cambridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      One associated his name with the enfranchisement of labor, with the
      emancipation of millions, with the salvation of the Republic. He is known
      to us as Abraham Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other broke the chains of superstition and filled the world with
      intellectual light, and he is known as Charles Darwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing is grander than to break chains from the bodies of men&mdash;nothing
      nobler than to destroy the phantoms of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because of these two men the nineteenth century is illustrious.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few men and women make a nation glorious&mdash;Shakespeare made England
      immortal, Voltaire civilized and humanized France; Goethe, Schiller and
      Humboldt lifted Germany into the light. Angelo, Raphael, Galileo and Bruno
      crowned with fadeless laurel the Italian brow, and now the most precious
      treasure of the Great Republic is the memory of Abraham Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every generation has its heroes, its iconoclasts, its pioneers, its
      ideals. The people always have been and still are divided, at least into
      classes&mdash;the many, who with their backs to the sunrise worship the
      past, and the few, who keep their faces toward the dawn&mdash;the many,
      who are satisfied with the world as it is; the few, who labor and suffer
      for the future, for those to be, and who seek to rescue the oppressed, to
      destroy the cruel distinctions of caste, and to civilize mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet it sometimes happens that the liberator of one age becomes the
      oppressor of the next. His reputation becomes so great&mdash;he is so
      revered and worshiped&mdash;that his followers, in his name, attack the
      hero who endeavors to take another step in advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heroes of the Revolution, forgetting the justice for which they
      fought, put chains upon the limbs of others, and in their names the lovers
      of liberty were denounced as ingrates and traitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the Revolution our fathers to justify their rebellion dug down to
      the bed-rock of human rights and planted their standard there. They
      declared that all men were entitled to liberty and that government derived
      its power from the consent of the governed. But when victory came, the
      great principles were forgotten and chains were put upon the limbs of men.
      Both of the great political parties were controlled by greed and
      selfishness. Both were the defenders and protectors of slavery. For nearly
      three-quarters of a century these parties had control of the Republic. The
      principal object of both parties was the protection of the infamous
      institution. Both were eager to secure the Southern vote and both
      sacrificed principle and honor upon the altar of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the Whig party died and the Republican was born. This party was
      opposed to the further extension of slavery. The Democratic party of the
      South wished to make the "divine institution" national&mdash;while the
      Democrats of the North wanted the question decided by each territory for
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each of these parties had conservatives and extremists. The extremists of
      the Democratic party were in the rear and wished to go back; the
      extremists of the Republican party were in the front, and wished to go
      forward. The extreme Democrat was willing to destroy the Union for the
      sake of slavery, and the extreme Republican was willing to destroy the
      Union for the sake of liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither party could succeed without the votes of its extremists.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the condition in 1858-60.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lincoln was a child his parents removed from Kentucky to Indiana. A
      few trees were felled&mdash;a log hut open to the south, no floor, no
      window, was built&mdash;a little land plowed and here the Lincolns lived.
      Here the patient, thoughtful, silent, loving mother died&mdash;died in the
      wide forest as a leaf dies, leaving nothing to her son but the memory of
      her love.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few years the family moved to Illinois. Lincoln then almost grown,
      clad in skins, with no woven stitch upon his body&mdash;walking and
      driving the cattle. Another farm was opened&mdash;a few acres subdued and
      enough raised to keep the wolf from the door. Lincoln quit the farm&mdash;went
      down the Ohio and Mississippi as a hand on a flat-boat&mdash;afterward
      clerked in a country store&mdash;then in partnership with another bought
      the store&mdash;failed. Nothing left but a few debts&mdash;learned the art
      of surveying&mdash;made about half a living and paid something on the
      debts&mdash;read law&mdash;admitted to the bar&mdash;tried a few small
      cases&mdash;nominated for the Legislature and made a speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      This speech was in favor of a tariff, not only for revenue, but to
      encourage American manufacturers and to protect American workingmen.
      Lincoln knew then as well as we do now, that everything, to the limits of
      the possible, that Americans use should be produced by the energy, skill
      and ingenuity of Americans. He knew that the more industries we had, the
      greater variety of things we made, the greater would be the development of
      the American brain. And he knew that great men and great women are the
      best things that a nation can produce,&mdash;the finest crop a country can
      possibly raise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that a nation that sells raw material will grow ignorant and poor,
      while the people who manufacture will grow intelligent and rich. To dig,
      to chop, to plow, requires more muscle than mind, more strength than
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      To invent, to manufacture, to take advantage of the forces of nature&mdash;this
      requires thought, talent, genius. This develops the brain and gives wings
      to the imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is better for Americans to purchase from Americans, even if the things
      purchased cost more.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we purchase a ton of steel rails from England for twenty dollars, then
      we have the rails and England the money; But if we buy a ton of steel
      rails from an American for twenty-five dollars, then America has both the
      rails and the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      Judging from the present universal depression and the recent elections,
      Lincoln, in his first speech, stood on solid rock and was absolutely
      right. Lincoln was educated in the University of Nature&mdash;educated by
      cloud and star&mdash;by field and winding stream&mdash;by billowed plains
      and solemn forests&mdash;by morning's birth and death of day&mdash;by
      storm and night&mdash;by the ever eager Spring&mdash;by Summer's wealth of
      leaf and vine and flower&mdash;the sad and transient glories of the Autumn
      woods&mdash;and Winter, builder of home and fireside, and whose storms
      without, create the social warmth within.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was perfectly acquainted with the political questions of the day&mdash;heard
      them discussed at taverns and country stores, at voting places and courts
      and on the stump. He knew all the arguments for and against, and no man of
      his time was better equipped for intellectual conflict. He knew the
      average mind&mdash;the thoughts of the people, the hopes and prejudices of
      his fellow-men. He had the power of accurate statement. He was logical,
      candid and sincere. In addition, he had the "touch of nature that makes
      the whole world kin."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1858 he was a candidate for the Senate against Stephen A. Douglas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extreme Democrats would not vote for Douglas, but the extreme
      Republicans did vote for Lincoln. Lincoln occupied the middle ground, and
      was the compromise candidate of his own party. He had lived for many years
      in the intellectual territory of compromise&mdash;in a part of our country
      settled by Northern and Southern men&mdash;where Northern and Southern
      ideas met, and the ideas of the two sections were brought together and
      compared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sympathies of Lincoln, his ties of kindred, were with the South. His
      convictions, his sense of justice, and his ideals, were with the North. He
      knew the horrors of slavery, and he felt the unspeakable ecstasies and
      glories of freedom. He had the kindness, the gentleness, of true
      greatness, and he could not have been a master; he had the manhood and
      independence of true greatness, and he could not have been a slave. He was
      just, and was incapable of putting a burden upon others that he himself
      would not willingly bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was merciful and profound, and it was not necessary for him to read the
      history of the world to know that liberty and slavery could not live in
      the same nation, or in the same brain. Lincoln was a statesman.. And there
      is this difference between a politician and a statesman. A politician
      schemes and works in every way to make the people do something for him. A
      statesman wishes to do something for the people. With him place and power
      are means to an end, and the end is the good of his country.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this campaign Lincoln demonstrated three things&mdash;first, that he
      was the intellectual superior of his opponent; second, that he was right;
      and third, that a majority of the voters of Illinois were on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      II.
    </p>
    <p>
      IN 1860 the Republic reached a crisis. The conflict between liberty and
      slavery could no longer be delayed. For three-quarters of a century the
      forces had been gathering for the battle.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the Revolution, principle was sacrificed for the sake of gain. The
      Constitution contradicted the Declaration. Liberty as a principle was held
      in contempt. Slavery took possession of the Government. Slavery made the
      laws, corrupted courts, dominated Presidents and demoralized the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not hold the South responsible for slavery any more than I do the
      North. The fact is, that individuals and nations act as they must. There
      is no chance. Back of every event&mdash;of every hope, prejudice, fancy
      and dream&mdash;of every opinion and belief&mdash;of every vice and virtue&mdash;of
      every smile and curse, is the efficient cause. The present moment is the
      child, and the necessary child, of all the past.
    </p>
    <p>
      Northern politicians wanted office, and so they defended slavery; Northern
      merchants wanted to sell their goods to the South, and so they were the
      enemies of freedom. The preacher wished to please the people who paid his
      salary, and so he denounced the slave for not being satisfied with the
      position in which the good God had placed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The respectable, the rich, the prosperous, the holders of and the seekers
      for office, held liberty in contempt. They regarded the Constitution as
      far more sacred than the rights of men. Candidates for the presidency were
      applauded because they had tried to make slave States of free territory,
      and the highest court solemnly and ignorantly decided that colored men and
      women had no rights. Men who insisted that freedom was better than
      slavery, and that mothers should not be robbed of their babes, were hated,
      despised and mobbed. Mr. Douglas voiced the feelings of millions when he
      declared that he did not care whether slavery was voted up or down. Upon
      this question the people, a majority of them, were almost savages. Honor,
      manhood, conscience, principle&mdash;all sacrificed for the sake of gain
      or office.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the heights of philosophy&mdash;standing above the contending hosts,
      above the prejudices, the sentimentalities of the day&mdash;Lincoln was
      great enough and brave enough and wise enough to utter these prophetic
      words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this Government
      cannot permanently endure half slave and half free. I do not expect the
      Union to be dissolved; I do not expect the house to fall; but I do expect
      it will cease to be divided. It will become all the one thing or the
      other. Either the opponents of slavery will arrest the further spread of
      it, and place it where the public mind shall rest in the belief that it is
      in the course of ultimate extinction, or its advocates will push it
      further until it becomes alike lawful in all the States, old as well as
      new, North as well as South."
    </p>
    <p>
      This declaration was the standard around which gathered the grandest
      political party the world has ever seen, and this declaration made Lincoln
      the leader of that vast host.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this, the first great crisis, Lincoln uttered the victorious truth that
      made him the foremost man in the Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Republican party nominated him for the presidency and the people
      decided at the polls that a house divided against itself could not stand,
      and that slavery had cursed soul and soil enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not a common thing to elect a really great man to fill the highest
      official position. I do not say that the great Presidents have been chosen
      by accident. Probably it would be better to say that they were the
      favorites of a happy chance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average man is afraid of genius. He feels as an awkward man feels in
      the presence of a sleight-of-hand performer. He admires and suspects.
      Genius appears to carry too much sail&mdash;to lack prudence, has too much
      courage. The ballast of dullness inspires confidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a happy chance Lincoln was nominated and elected in spite of his
      fitness&mdash;and the patient, gentle, just and loving man was called upon
      to bear as great a burden as man has ever borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      III.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEN came another crisis&mdash;the crisis of Secession and Civil war.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Lincoln spoke the deepest feeling and the highest thought of the
      Nation. In his first message he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The central idea of secession is the essence of anarchy."
    </p>
    <p>
      He also showed conclusively that the North and South, in spite of
      secession, must remain face to face&mdash;that physically they could not
      separate&mdash;that they must have more or less commerce, and that this
      commerce must be carried on either between the two sections as friends, or
      as aliens.
    </p>
    <p>
      This situation and its consequences he pointed out to absolute perfection
      in these words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Can aliens make treaties easier than friends can make laws? Can treaties
      be more faithfully enforced between aliens than laws among friends?"
    </p>
    <p>
      After having stated fully and fairly the philosophy of the conflict, after
      having said enough to satisfy any calm and thoughtful mind, he addressed
      himself to the hearts of America. Probably there are few finer passages in
      literature than the close of Lincoln's inaugural address:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I am loth to close. We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be
      enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break, our bonds of
      affection. The mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield
      and patriotic grave to every loving heart and hearthstone all over this
      broad land, will swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as
      surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature."
    </p>
    <p>
      These noble, these touching, these pathetic words, were delivered in the
      presence of rebellion, in the midst of spies and conspirators&mdash;surrounded
      by but few friends, most of whom were unknown, and some of whom were
      wavering in their fidelity&mdash;at a time when secession was arrogant and
      organized, when patriotism was silent, and when, to quote the expressive
      words of Lincoln himself, "Sinners were calling the righteous to
      repentance."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Lincoln became President, he was held in contempt by the South&mdash;underrated
      by the North and East&mdash;not appreciated even by his cabinet&mdash;and
      yet he was not only one of the wisest, but one of the shrewdest of
      mankind. Knowing that he had the right to enforce the laws of the Union in
      all parts of the United States, and Territories&mdash;knowing, as he did,
      that the secessionists were in the wrong, he also knew that they had
      sympathizers not only in the North, but in other lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Consequently, he felt that it was of the utmost importance that the South
      should fire the first shot, should do some act that would solidify the
      North, and gain for us the justification of the civilized world.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proposed to give food to the soldiers at Sumter. He asked the advice of
      all his cabinet on this question, and all, with the exception of
      Montgomery Blair, answered in the negative, giving their reasons in
      writing. In spite of this, Lincoln took his own course&mdash;endeavored to
      send the supplies, and while thus engaged, doing his simple duty, the
      South commenced actual hostilities and fired on the fort. The course
      pursued by Lincoln was absolutely right, and the act of the South to a
      great extent solidified the North, and gained for the Republic the
      justification of a great number of people in other lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time Lincoln appreciated the scope and consequences of the
      impending conflict. Above all other thoughts in his mind was this:
    </p>
    <p>
      "This conflict will settle the question, at least for centuries to come,
      whether man is capable of governing himself, and consequently is of
      greater importance to the free than to the enslaved."
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew what depended on the issue and he said: "We shall nobly save, or
      meanly lose, the last, best hope of earth."
    </p>
    <p>
      HEN came a crisis in the North. It became clearer and clearer to Lincoln's
      mind, day by day, that the Rebellion was slavery, and that it was
      necessary to keep the border States on the side of the Union. For this
      purpose he proposed a scheme of emancipation and colonization&mdash;a
      scheme by which the owners of slaves should be paid the full value of what
      they called their "property."
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that if the border States agreed to gradual emancipation, and
      received compensation for their slaves, they would be forever lost to the
      Confederacy, whether secession succeeded or not. It was objected at the
      time, by some, that the scheme was far too expensive; but Lincoln, wiser
      than his advisers&mdash;far wiser than his enemies&mdash;demonstrated that
      from an economical point of view, his course was best.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      He proposed that $400 be paid for slaves, including men, women and
      children. This was a large price, and yet he showed how much cheaper it
      was to purchase than to carry on the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time, at the price mentioned, there were about $750,000 worth of
      slaves in Delaware. The cost of carrying on the war was at least two
      millions of dollars a day, and for one-third of one day's expenses, all
      the slaves in Delaware could be purchased. He also showed that all the
      slaves in Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky and Missouri could be bought, at
      the same price, for less than the expense of carrying on the war for
      eighty-seven days.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the wisest thing that could have been proposed, and yet such was
      the madness of the South, such the indignation of the North, that the
      advice was unheeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again, in July, 1862, he urged on the Representatives of the border States
      a scheme of gradual compensated emancipation; but the Representatives were
      too deaf to hear, too blind to see.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln always hated slavery, and yet he felt the obligations and duties
      of his position. In his first message he assured the South that the laws,
      including the most odious of all&mdash;the law for the return of fugitive
      slaves&mdash;would be enforced. The South would not hear. Afterward he
      proposed to purchase the slaves of the border States, but the proposition
      was hardly discussed&mdash;hardly heard. Events came thick and fast;
      theories gave way to facts, and everything was left to force.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extreme Democrat of the North was fearful that slavery might be
      destroyed, that the Constitution might be broken, and that Lincoln, after
      all, could not be trusted; and at the same time the radical Republican
      feared that Lincoln loved the Union more than he did liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact is, that he tried to discharge the obligations of his great
      office, knowing from the first that slavery must perish. The course
      pursued by Lincoln was so gentle, so kind and persistent, so wise and
      logical, that millions of Northern Democrats sprang to the defence, not
      only of the Union, but of his administration. Lincoln refused to be led or
      hurried by Fremont or Hunter, by Greeley or Sumner. From first to last he
      was the real leader, and he kept step with events.
    </p>
    <p>
      V.
    </p>
    <p>
      ON the 22d of July, 1862, Lincoln sent word to the members of his cabinet
      that he wished to see them. It so happened that Secretary Chase was the
      first to arrive. He found Lincoln reading a book. Looking up from the
      page, the President said: "Chase, did you ever read this book?" "What book
      is it?" asked Chase. "Artemus Ward," replied Lincoln. "Let me read you
      this chapter, entitled '<i>Wax Wurx in Albany</i>.'" And so he began
      reading while the other members of the cabinet one by one came in. At last
      Stanton told Mr. Lincoln that he was in a great hurry, and if any business
      was to be done he would like to do it at once. Whereupon Mr. Lincoln laid
      down the open book, opened a drawer, took out a paper and said:
      "Gentlemen, I have called you together to notify you what I have
      determined to do. I want no advice. Nothing can change my mind."
    </p>
    <p>
      He then read the Proclamation of Emancipation. Chase thought there ought
      to be something about God at the close, to which Lincoln replied: "Put it
      in, it won't hurt it." It was also agreed that the President would wait
      for a victory in the field before giving the Proclamation to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting was over, the members went their way. Mr. Chase was the last
      to go, and as he went through the door looked back and saw that Mr.
      Lincoln had taken up the book and was again engrossed in the <i>Wax Wurx
      at Albany.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      This was on the 22d of July, 1862. On the 22d of August of the same year&mdash;after
      Lincoln wrote his celebrated letter to Horace Greeley, in which he stated
      that his object was to save the Union; <i>that he would save it with
      slavery if he could</i>; that if it was necessary to destroy slavery in
      order to save the Union, he would; in other words, he would do what was
      necessary to save the Union.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter disheartened, to a great degree, thousands and millions of the
      friends of freedom. They felt that Mr. Lincoln had not attained the moral
      height upon which they supposed he stood. And yet, when this letter was
      written, the Emancipation Proclamation was in his hands, and had been for
      thirty days, waiting only an opportunity to give it to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some two weeks after the letter to Greeley, Lincoln was waited on by a
      committee of clergymen, and was by them informed that it was God's will
      that he should issue a Proclamation of Emancipation. He replied to them,
      in substance, that the day of miracles had passed. He also mildly and
      kindly suggested that if it were God's will this Proclamation should be
      issued, certainly God would have made known that will to him&mdash;to the
      person whose duty it was to issue it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 22d day of September, 1862, the most glorious date in the history
      of the Republic, the Proclamation of Emancipation was issued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln had reached the generalization of all argument upon the question
      of slavery and freedom&mdash;a generalization that never has been, and
      probably never will be, excelled:
    </p>
    <p>
      "In giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is absolutely true. Liberty can be retained, can be enjoyed, only by
      giving it to others. The spendthrift saves, the miser is prodigal. In the
      realm of Freedom, waste is husbandry. He who puts chains upon the body of
      another shackles his own soul. The moment the Proclamation was issued the
      cause of the Republic became sacred. From that moment the North fought for
      the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that moment the North stood under the blue and stars, the flag of
      Nature, sublime and free.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1831, Lincoln went down the Mississippi on a flat-boat. He received the
      extravagant salary of ten dollars a month. When he reached New Orleans, he
      and some of his companions went about the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other places, they visited a slave market, where men and women were
      being sold at auction. A young colored girl was on the block. Lincoln
      heard the brutal words of the auctioneer&mdash;the savage remarks of
      bidders. The scene filled his soul with indignation and horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning to his companions, he said, "Boys, if I ever get a chance to hit
      slavery, by God I'll hit it hard!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The helpless girl, unconsciously, had planted in a great heart the seeds
      of the Proclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thirty-one years afterward the chance came, the oath was kept, and to four
      millions of slaves, of men, women and children, was restored liberty, the
      jewel of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the history, in the fiction of the world, there is nothing more
      intensely dramatic than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln held within his brain the grandest truths, and he held them as
      unconsciously, as easily, as naturally, as a waveless pool holds within
      its stainless breast a thousand stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these two years we had traveled from the Ordinance of Secession to the
      Proclamation of Emancipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI.
    </p>
    <p>
      WE were surrounded by enemies. Many of the so-called great in Europe and
      England were against us. They hated the Republic, despised our
      institutions, and sought in many ways to aid the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gladstone announced that Jefferson Davis had made a nation, and that
      he did not believe the restoration of the American Union by force
      attainable.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Vatican came words of encouragement for the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was declared that the North was fighting for empire and the South for
      independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Marquis of Salisbury said: "The people of the South are the natural
      allies of England. The North keeps an opposition shop in the same
      department of trade as ourselves."
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a very elevated sentiment&mdash;but English.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of their statesmen declared that the subjugation of the South by the
      North would be a calamity to the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis Napoleon was another enemy, and he endeavored to establish a
      monarchy in Mexico, to the end that the great North might be destroyed.
      But the patience, the uncommon common sense, the statesmanship of Lincoln&mdash;in
      spite of foreign hate and Northern division&mdash;triumphed over all. And
      now we forgive all foes. Victory makes forgiveness easy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln was by nature a diplomat. He knew the art of sailing against the
      wind. He had as much shrewdness as is consistent with honesty. He
      understood, not only the rights of individuals, but of nations. In all his
      correspondence with other governments he neither wrote nor sanctioned a
      line which afterward was used to tie his hands. In the use of perfect
      English he easily rose above all his advisers and all his fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one claims that Lincoln did all. He could have done nothing without the
      generals in the field, and the generals could have done nothing without
      their armies. The praise is due to all&mdash;to the private as much as to
      the officer; to the lowest who did his duty, as much as to the highest.
    </p>
    <p>
      My heart goes out to the brave private as much as to the leader of the
      host.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Lincoln stood at the centre and with infinite patience, with
      consummate skill, with the genius of goodness, directed, cheered, consoled
      and conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      SLAVERY was the cause of the war, and slavery was the perpetual
      stumbling-block. As the war went on, question after question arose&mdash;questions
      that could not be answered by theories. Should we hand back the slave to
      his master, when the master was using his slave to destroy the Union? If
      the South was right, slaves were property, and by the laws of war anything
      that might be used to the advantage of the enemy might be confiscated by
      us. Events did not wait for discussion. General Butler denominated the
      negro as "a contraband." Congress provided that the property of the rebels
      might be confiscated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extreme Democrats of the North regarded the slave as more sacred than
      life. It was no harm to kill the master&mdash;to burn his house, to ravage
      his fields&mdash;but you must not free his slave. If in war a nation has
      the right to take the property of its citizens&mdash;of its friends&mdash;certainly
      it has the right to take the property of those it has the right to kill.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln was wise enough to know that war is governed by the laws of war,
      and that during the conflict constitutions are silent. All that he could
      do he did in the interests of peace. He offered to execute every law&mdash;including
      the most infamous of all&mdash;to buy the slaves in the border States&mdash;to
      establish gradual, compensated emancipation; but the South would not hear.
      Then he confiscated the property of rebels&mdash;treated the slaves as
      contraband of war, used them to put down the Rebellion, armed them and
      clothed them in the uniform of the Republic&mdash;was in favor of making
      them citizens and allowing them to stand on an equality with their white
      brethren under the flag of the Nation. During these years Lincoln moved
      with events, and every step he took has been justified by the considerate
      judgment of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      LINCOLN not only watched the war, but kept his hand on the political
      pulse. In 1863 a tide set in against the administration. A Republican
      meeting was to be held in Springfield, Illinois, and Lincoln wrote a
      letter to be read at this convention. It was in his happiest vein. It was
      a perfect defence of his administration, including the Proclamation of
      Emancipation. Among other things he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But the proclamation, as law, either is valid or it is not valid. If it
      is not valid it needs no retraction, but if it is valid it cannot be
      retracted, any more than the dead can be brought to life."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Northern Democrats who said they would not fight for negroes,
      Lincoln replied:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Some of them seem willing to fight for you&mdash;but no matter."
    </p>
    <p>
      Of negro soldiers:
    </p>
    <p>
      "But negroes, like other people, act upon motives. Why should they do
      anything for us if we will do nothing for them? If they stake their lives
      for us they must be prompted by the strongest motive&mdash;even the
      promise of freedom. And the promise, being made, must be kept."
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one line in this letter that will give it immortality:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The Father of waters again goes unvexed to the sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      This line is worthy of Shakespeare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Among free men there can be no successful appeal from the ballot to the
      bullet."
    </p>
    <p>
      He draws a comparison between the white men against us and the black men
      for us:
    </p>
    <p>
      "And then there will be some black men who can remember that with silent
      tongue and clenched teeth and steady eye and well-poised bayonet they have
      helped mankind on to this great consummation; while I fear there will be
      some white ones unable to forget that with malignant heart and deceitful
      speech they strove to hinder it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the influence of this letter, the love of country, of the Union, and
      above all, the love of liberty, took possession of the heroic North.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was the greatest moral exaltation ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of liberty took possession of the people. The masses became
      sublime.
    </p>
    <p>
      To fight for yourself is natural&mdash;to fight for others is grand; to
      fight for your country is noble&mdash;to fight for the human race&mdash;for
      the liberty of hand and brain&mdash;is nobler still.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, the defenders of slavery had sown the seeds of their
      own defeat. They dug the pit in which they fell. Clay and Webster and
      thousands of others had by their eloquence made the Union almost sacred.
      The Union was the very tree of life, the source and stream and sea of
      liberty and law.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the sake of slavery millions stood by the Union, for the sake of
      liberty millions knelt at the altar of the Union; and this love of the
      Union is what, at last, overwhelmed the Confederate hosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      It does not seem possible that only a few years ago our Constitution, our
      laws, our Courts, the Pulpit and the Press defended and upheld the
      institution of slavery&mdash;that it was a crime to feed the hungry&mdash;to
      give water to the lips of thirst&mdash;shelter to a woman flying from the
      whip and chain!
    </p>
    <p>
      The old flag still flies&mdash;the stars are there&mdash;the stains have
      gone.

      IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      LINCOLN always saw the end. He was unmoved by the storms and currents of
      the times. He advanced too rapidly for the conservative politicians, too
      slowly for the radical enthusiasts. He occupied the line of safety, and
      held by his personality&mdash;by the force of his great character, by his
      charming candor&mdash;the masses on his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      The soldiers thought of him as a father.
    </p>
    <p>
      All who had lost their sons in battle felt that they had his sympathy&mdash;felt
      that his face was as sad as theirs. They knew that Lincoln was actuated by
      one motive, and that his energies were bent to the attainment of one end&mdash;the
      salvation of the Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      They knew that he was kind, sincere and merciful. They knew that in his
      veins there was no drop of tyrants' blood. They knew that he used his
      power to protect the innocent, to save reputation and life&mdash;that he
      had the brain of a philosopher&mdash;the heart of a mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      During all the years of war, Lincoln stood the embodiment of mercy,
      between discipline and death. He pitied the imprisoned and condemned. He
      took the unfortunate in his arms, and was the friend even of the convict.
      He knew temptation's strength&mdash;the weakness of the will&mdash;and how
      in fury's sudden flame the judgment drops the scales, and passion&mdash;blind
      and deaf&mdash;usurps the throne.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day a woman, accompanied by a Senator, called on the President. The
      woman was the wife of one of Mosby's men. Her husband had been captured,
      tried and condemned to be shot. She came to ask for the pardon of her
      husband. The President heard her story and then asked what kind of man her
      husband was. "Is he intemperate, does he abuse the children and beat you?"
      "No, no," said the wife, "he is a good man, a good husband, he loves me
      and he loves the children, and we cannot live without him. The only
      trouble is that he is a fool about politics&mdash;I live in the North,
      born there, and if I get him home, he will do no more fighting for the
      South." "Well," said Mr. Lincoln, after examining the papers, "I will
      pardon your husband and turn him over to you for safe keeping." The poor
      woman, overcome with joy, sobbed as though her heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      "My dear woman," said Lincoln, "if I had known how badly it was going to
      make you feel, I never would have pardoned him." "You do not understand
      me," she cried between her sobs. "You do not understand me." "Yes, yes, I
      do," answered the President, "and if you do not go away at once I shall be
      crying with you."
    </p>
    <p>
      On another occasion, a member of Congress, on his way to see Lincoln,
      found in one of the anterooms of the White House an old white-haired man,
      sobbing&mdash;his wrinkled face wet with tears. The old man told him that
      for several days he had tried to see the President&mdash;that he wanted a
      pardon for his son. The Congressman told the old man to come with him and
      he would introduce him to Mr. Lincoln. On being introduced, the old man
      said: "Mr. Lincoln, my wife sent me to you. We had three boys. They all
      joined your army. One of 'em has been killed, one's a fighting now, and
      one of 'em, the youngest, has been tried for deserting and he's going to
      be shot day after to-morrow. He never deserted. He's wild, and he may have
      drunk too much and wandered off, but he never deserted. 'Taint in the
      blood. He's his mother's favorite, and if he's shot, I know she'll die."
      The President, turning to his secretary, said: "Telegraph General Butler
      to suspend the execution in the case of&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;[giving
      the name] until further orders from me, and ask him to answer&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Congressman congratulated the old man on his success&mdash;but the old
      man did not respond. He was not satisfied. "Mr. President," he began, "I
      can't take that news home. It won't satisfy his mother. How do I know but
      what you'll give further orders to-morrow?" "My good man," said Mr.
      Lincoln, "I have to do the best I can. The generals are complaining
      because I pardon so many. They say that my mercy destroys discipline. Now,
      when you get home you tell his mother what you said to me about my giving
      further orders, and then you tell her that I said this: 'If your son lives
      until they get further orders from me, that when he does die people will
      say that old Methusaleh was a baby compared to him.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The pardoning power is the only remnant of absolute sovereignty that a
      President has. Through all the years, Lincoln will be known as Lincoln the
      loving, Lincoln the merciful.
    </p>
    <p>
      X.
    </p>
    <p>
      LINCOLN had the keenest sense of humor, and always saw the laughable side
      even of disaster. In his humor there was logic and the best of sense. No
      matter how complicated the question, or how embarrassing the situation,
      his humor furnished an answer and a door of escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Vallandigham was a friend of the South, and did what he could to sow the
      seeds of failure. In his opinion everything, except rebellion, was
      unconstitutional.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was arrested, convicted by a court martial, and sentenced to
      imprisonment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was doubt about the legality of the trial, and thousands in the
      North denounced the whole proceeding as tyrannical and infamous. At the
      same time millions demanded that Vallandigham should be punished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln's humor came to the rescue. He disapproved of the findings of the
      court, changed the punishment, and ordered that Mr. Vallandigham should be
      sent to his friends in the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who regarded the act as unconstitutional almost forgave it for the
      sake of its humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horace Greeley always had the idea that he was greatly superior to
      Lincoln, because he lived in a larger town, and for a long time insisted
      that the people of the North and the people of the South desired peace. He
      took it upon himself to lecture Lincoln. Lincoln, with that wonderful
      sense of humor, united with shrewdness and profound wisdom, told Greeley
      that, if the South really wanted peace, he (Lincoln) desired the same
      thing, and was doing all he could to bring it about. Greeley insisted that
      a commissioner should be appointed, with authority to negotiate with the
      representatives of the Confederacy. This was Lincoln's opportunity. He
      authorized Greeley to act as such commissioner. The great editor felt that
      he was caught. For a time he hesitated, but finally went, and found that
      the Southern commissioners were willing to take into consideration any
      offers of peace that Lincoln might make, consistent with the independence
      of the Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The failure of Greeley was humiliating, and the position in which he was
      left, absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the humor of Lincoln had triumphed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln, to satisfy a few fault-finders in the North, went to Grant's
      headquarters and met some Confederate commissioners. He urged that it was
      hardly proper for him to negotiate with the representatives of rebels in
      arms&mdash;that if the South wanted peace, all they had to do was to stop
      fighting. One of the commissioners cited as a precedent the fact that
      Charles the First negotiated with rebels in arms. To which Lincoln replied
      that Charles the First lost his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference came to nothing, as Mr. Lincoln expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The commissioners, one of them being Alexander H. Stephens, who, when in
      good health, weighed about ninety pounds, dined with the President and
      Gen. Grant. After dinner, as they were leaving, Stephens put on an English
      ulster, the tails of which reached the ground, while the collar was
      somewhat above the wearer's head.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Stephens went out, Lincoln touched Grant and said: "Grant, look at
      Stephens. Did you ever see as little a nubbin with as much shuck?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln always tried to do things in the easiest way. He did not waste his
      strength. He was not particular about moving along straight lines. He did
      not tunnel the mountains. He was willing to go around, and reach the end
      desired as a river reaches the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      XI.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the most wonderful things ever done by Lincoln was the promotion of
      General Hooker. After the battle of Fredericksburg, General Burnside found
      great fault with Hooker, and wished to have him removed from the Army of
      the Potomac. Lincoln disapproved of Burnside's order, and gave Hooker the
      command. He then wrote Hooker this memorable letter:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of course I
      have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient reasons, and yet I
      think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to
      which I am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to be a brave and
      skillful soldier&mdash;which, of course, I like. I also believe you do not
      mix politics with your profession&mdash;in which you are right. You have
      confidence&mdash;which is a valuable, if not an indispensable, quality.
      You are ambitious, which, within reasonable bounds, does good rather than
      harm; but I think that during General Burnside's command of the army you
      have taken counsel of your ambition to thwart him as much as you could&mdash;in
      which you did a great wrong to the country and to a most meritorious and
      honorable brother officer. I have heard, in such a way as to believe it,
      of your recently saying that both the army and the Government needed a
      dictator. Of course it was not for this, but in spite of it, that I have
      given you command. Only those generals who gain successes can set up
      dictators. What I now ask of you is military successes, and I will risk
      the dictatorship. The Government will support you to the utmost of its
      ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and will do for
      all commanders. I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse
      into the army, of criticising their commander and withholding confidence
      in him, will now turn upon you. I shall assist you, so far as I can, to
      put it down. Neither you, nor Napoleon, if he were alive, can get any good
      out of an army while such a spirit prevails in it. And now beware of
      rashness. Beware of rashness, but with energy and sleepless vigilance go
      forward and give us victories."
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter has, in my judgment, no parallel. The mistaken magnanimity is
      almost equal to the prophecy:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I much fear that the spirit which you have aided to infuse into the army,
      of criticising their command and withholding confidence in him, will now
      turn upon you."
    </p>
    <p>
      Chancellorsville was the fulfillment.
    </p>
    <p>
      XII.
    </p>
    <p>
      MR. LINCOLN was a statesman. The great stumbling-block&mdash;the great
      obstruction&mdash;in Lincoln's way, and in the way of thousands, was the
      old doctrine of States Rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine was first established to protect slavery. It was clung to to
      protect the inter-State slave trade. It became sacred in connection with
      the Fugitive Slave Law, and it was finally used as the corner-stone of
      Secession.
    </p>
    <p>
      This doctrine was never appealed to in defence of the right&mdash;always
      in support of the wrong. For many years politicians upon both sides of
      this question endeavored to express the exact relations existing between
      the Federal Government and the States, and I know of no one who succeeded,
      except Lincoln. In his message of 1861, delivered on July the 4th, the
      definition is given, and it is perfect:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Whatever concerns the whole should be confided to the whole&mdash;to the
      General Government. Whatever concerns only the State should be left
      exclusively to the State."
    </p>
    <p>
      When that definition is realized in practice, this country becomes a
      Nation. Then we shall know that the first allegiance of the citizen is not
      to his State, but to the Republic, and that the first duty of the Republic
      is to protect the citizen, not only when in other lands, but at home, and
      that this duty cannot be discharged by delegating it to the States.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln believed in the sovereignty of the people&mdash;in the supremacy
      of the Nation&mdash;in the territorial integrity of the Republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      A GREAT actor can be known only when he has assumed the principal
      character in a great drama. Possibly the greatest actors have never
      appeared, and it may be that the greatest soldiers have lived the lives of
      perfect peace. Lincoln assumed the leading part in the greatest drama ever
      enacted upon the stage of this continent.
    </p>
    <p>
      His criticisms of military movements, his correspondence with his generals
      and others on the conduct of the war, show that he was at all times master
      of the situation&mdash;that he was a natural strategist, that he
      appreciated the difficulties and advantages of every kind, and that in
      "the still and mental" field of war he stood the peer of any man beneath
      the flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had McClellan followed his advice, he would have taken Richmond.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had Hooker acted in accordance with his suggestions, Chancellorsville
      would have been a victory for the Nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln's political prophecies were all fulfilled.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know now that he not only stood at the top, but that he occupied the
      centre, from first to last, and that he did this by reason of his
      intelligence, his humor, his philosophy, his courage and his patriotism.
    </p>
    <p>
      In passion's storm he stood, unmoved, patient, just and candid. In his
      brain there was no cloud, and in his heart no hate. He longed to save the
      South as well as North, to see the Nation one and free.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived until the end was known.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived until the Confederacy was dead&mdash;until Lee surrendered, until
      Davis fled, until the doors of Libby Prison were opened, until the
      Republic was supreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived until Lincoln and Liberty were united forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived to cross the desert&mdash;to reach the palms of victory&mdash;to
      hear the murmured music of the welcome waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived until all loyal hearts were his&mdash;until the history of his
      deeds made music in the souls of men&mdash;until he knew that on
      Columbia's Calendar of worth and fame his name stood first.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived until there remained nothing for him to do as great as he had
      done.
    </p>
    <p>
      What he did was worth living for, worth dying for.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lived until he stood in the midst of universal
    </p>
    <p>
      Joy, beneath the outstretched wings of Peace&mdash;the foremost man in all
      the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then the horror came. Night fell on noon. The Savior of the Republic,
      the breaker of chains, the liberator of millions, he who had "assured
      freedom to the free," was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon his brow Fame placed the immortal wreath, and for the first time in
      the history of the world a Nation bowed and wept.
    </p>
    <p>
      The memory of Lincoln is the strongest, tenderest tie that binds all
      hearts together now, and holds all States beneath a Nation's flag.
    </p>
    <p>
      XIV.
    </p>
    <p>
      ABRAHAM LINCOLN&mdash;strange mingling of mirth and tears, of the tragic
      and grotesque, of cap and crown, of Socrates and Democritus, of &#65533;?sop
      and Marcus Aurelius, of all that is gentle and just, humorous and honest,
      merciful, wise, laughable, lovable and divine, and all consecrated to the
      use of man; while through all, and over all, were an overwhelming sense of
      obligation, of chivalric loyalty to truth, and upon all, the shadow of the
      tragic end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly all the great historic characters are impossible monsters,
      disproportioned by flattery, or by calumny deformed. We know nothing of
      their peculiarities, or nothing but their peculiarities. About these oaks
      there clings none of the earth of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Washington is now only a steel engraving. About the real man who lived and
      loved and hated and schemed, we know but little. The glass through which
      we look at him is of such high magnifying power that the features are
      exceedingly indistinct.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hundreds of people are now engaged in smoothing out the lines of Lincoln's
      face&mdash;forcing all features to the common mould&mdash;so that he may
      be known, not as he really was, but, according to their poor standard, as
      he should have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln was not a type. He stands alone&mdash;no ancestors, no fellows,
      and no successors.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the advantage of living in a new country, of social equality, of
      personal freedom, of seeing in the horizon of his future the perpetual
      star of hope. He preserved his individuality and his self-respect. He knew
      and mingled with men of every kind; and, after all, men are the best
      books. He became acquainted with the ambitions and hopes of the heart, the
      means used to accomplish ends, the springs of action and the seeds of
      thought. He was familiar with nature, with actual things, with common
      facts. He loved and appreciated the poem of the year, the drama of the
      seasons.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a new country a man must possess at least three virtues&mdash;honesty,
      courage and generosity. In cultivated society, cultivation is often more
      important than soil. A well-executed counterfeit passes more readily than
      a blurred genuine. It is necessary only to observe the unwritten laws of
      society&mdash;to be honest enough to keep out of prison, and generous
      enough to subscribe in public&mdash;where the subscription can be defended
      as an investment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a new country, character is essential; in the old, reputation is
      sufficient. In the new, they find what a man really is; in the old, he
      generally passes for what he resembles. People separated only by distance
      are much nearer together, than those divided by the walls of caste.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is no advantage to live in a great city, where poverty degrades and
      failure brings despair. The fields are lovelier than paved streets, and
      the great forests than walls of brick. Oaks and elms are more poetic than
      steeples and chimneys.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the country is the idea of home. There you see the rising and setting
      sun; you become acquainted with the stars and clouds. The constellations
      are your friends. You hear the rain on the roof and listen to the rhythmic
      sighing of the winds. You are thrilled by the resurrection called Spring,
      touched and saddened by Autumn&mdash;the grace and poetry of death. Every
      field is a picture, a landscape; every landscape a poem; every flower a
      tender thought, and every forest a fairy-land. In the country you preserve
      your identity&mdash;your personality. There you are an aggregation of
      atoms, but in the city you are only an atom of an aggregation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the country you keep your cheek close to the breast of Nature. You are
      calmed and ennobled by the space, the amplitude and scope of earth and sky&mdash;by
      the constancy of the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln never finished his education. To the night of his death he was a
      pupil, a learner, an inquirer, a seeker after knowledge. You have no idea
      how many men are spoiled by what is called education. For the most part,
      colleges are places where pebbles are polished and diamonds are dimmed. If
      Shakespeare had graduated at Oxford, he might have been a quibbling
      attorney, or a hypocritical parson.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln was a great lawyer. There is nothing shrewder in this world than
      intelligent honesty. Perfect candor is sword and shield.
    </p>
    <p>
      He understood the nature of man. As a lawyer he endeavored to get at the
      truth, at the very heart of a case. He was not willing even to deceive
      himself. No matter what his interest said, what his passion demanded, he
      was great enough to find the truth and strong enough to pronounce judgment
      against his own desires.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln was a many-sided man, acquainted with smiles and tears, complex in
      brain, single in heart, direct as light; and his words, candid as mirrors,
      gave the perfect image of his thought. He was never afraid to ask&mdash;never
      too dignified to admit that he did not know. No man had keener wit, or
      kinder humor.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be that humor is the pilot of reason. People without humor drift
      unconsciously into absurdity. Humor sees the other side&mdash;stands in
      the mind like a spectator, a good-natured critic, and gives its opinion
      before judgment is reached. Humor goes with good nature, and good nature
      is the climate of reason. In anger, reason abdicates and malice
      extinguishes the torch. Such was the humor of Lincoln that he could tell
      even unpleasant truths as charmingly as most men can tell the things we
      wish to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not solemn. Solemnity is a mask worn by ignorance and hypocrisy&mdash;it
      is the preface, prologue, and index to the cunning or the stupid.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was natural in his life and thought&mdash;master of the story-teller's
      art, in illustration apt, in application perfect, liberal in speech,
      shocking Pharisees and prudes, using any word that wit could disinfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a logician. His logic shed light. In its presence the obscure
      became luminous, and the most complex and intricate political and
      metaphysical knots seemed to untie themselves. Logic is the necessary
      product of intelligence and sincerity. It cannot be learned. It is the
      child of a clear head and a good heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln was candid, and with candor often deceived the deceitful. He had
      intellect without arrogance, genius without pride, and religion without
      cant&mdash;that is to say, without bigotry and without deceit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an orator&mdash;clear, sincere, natural. He did not pretend. He did
      not say what he thought others thought, but what he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to be sublime you must be natural&mdash;you must keep close to
      the grass. You must sit by the fireside of the heart; above the clouds it
      is too cold. You must be simple in your speech; too much polish suggests
      insincerity.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great orator idealizes the real, transfigures the common, makes even
      the inanimate throb and thrill, fills the gallery of the imagination with
      statues and pictures perfect in form and color, brings to light the gold
      hoarded by memory the miser, shows the glittering coin to the spendthrift
      hope, enriches the brain, ennobles the heart, and quickens the conscience.
      Between his lips words bud and blossom.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you wish to know the difference between an orator and an elocutionist&mdash;between
      what is felt and what is said&mdash;between what the heart and brain can
      do together and what the brain can do alone&mdash;read Lincoln's wondrous
      speech at Gettysburg, and then the oration of Edward Everett.
    </p>
    <p>
      The speech of Lincoln will never be forgotten. It will live until
      languages are dead and lips are dust. The oration of Everett will never be
      read.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elocutionists believe in the virtue of voice, the sublimity of syntax,
      the majesty of long sentences, and the genius of gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The orator loves the real, the simple, the natural. He places the thought
      above all. He knows that the greatest ideas should be expressed in the
      shortest words&mdash;that the greatest statues need the least drapery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln was an immense personality&mdash;firm but not obstinate. Obstinacy
      is egotism&mdash;firmness, heroism. He influenced others without effort,
      unconsciously; and they submitted to him as men submit to nature&mdash;unconsciously.
      He was severe with himself, and for that reason lenient with others.
    </p>
    <p>
      He appeared to apologize for being kinder than his fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did merciful things as stealthily as others committed crimes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost ashamed of tenderness, he said and did the noblest words and deeds
      with that charming confusion, that awkwardness, that is the perfect grace
      of modesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a noble man, wishing to pay a small debt to a poor neighbor,
      reluctantly offers a hundred-dollar bill and asks for change, fearing that
      he may be suspected either of making a display of wealth or a pretence of
      payment, so Lincoln hesitated to show his wealth of goodness, even to the
      best he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great man stooping, not wishing to make his fellows feel that they were
      small or mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      By his candor, by his kindness, by his perfect freedom from restraint, by
      saying what he thought, and saying it absolutely in his own way, he made
      it not only possible, but popular, to be natural. He was the enemy of mock
      solemnity, of the stupidly respectable, of the cold and formal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wore no official robes either on his body or his soul. He never
      pretended to be more or less, or other, or different, from what he really
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the unconscious naturalness of Nature's self.
    </p>
    <p>
      He built upon the rock. The foundation was secure and broad. The structure
      was a pyramid, narrowing as it rose. Through days and nights of sorrow,
      through years of grief and pain, with unswerving purpose, "with malice
      towards none, with charity for all," with infinite patience, with
      unclouded vision, he hoped and toiled. Stone after stone was laid, until
      at last the Proclamation found its place. On that the Goddess stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew others, because perfectly acquainted with himself. He cared
      nothing for place, but everything for principle; little for money, but
      everything for independence. Where no principle was involved, easily
      swayed&mdash;willing to go slowly, if in the right direction&mdash;sometimes
      willing to stop; but he would not go back, and he would not go wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was willing to wait. He knew that the event was not waiting, and that
      fate was not the fool of chance. He knew that slavery had defenders, but
      no defence, and that they who attack the right must wound themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was neither tyrant nor slave. He neither knelt nor scorned.
    </p>
    <p>
      With him, men were neither great nor small&mdash;they were right or wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through manners, clothes, titles, rags and race he saw the real&mdash;that
      which is. Beyond accident, policy, compromise and war he saw the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was patient as Destiny, whose undecipherable hieroglyphs were so deeply
      graven on his sad and tragic face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing discloses real character like the use of power. It is easy for the
      weak to be gentle. Most people can bear adversity. But if you wish to know
      what a man really is, give him power. This is the supreme test. It is the
      glory of Lincoln that, having almost absolute power, he never abused it,
      except on the side of mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Wealth could not purchase, power could not awe, this divine, this loving
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew no fear except the fear of doing wrong. Hating slavery, pitying
      the master&mdash;seeking to conquer, not persons, but prejudices&mdash;he
      was the embodiment of the self-denial, the courage, the hope and the
      nobility of a Nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke not to inflame, not to upbraid, but to convince.
    </p>
    <p>
      He raised his hands, not to strike, but in benediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He longed to pardon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He loved to see the pearls of joy on the cheeks of a wife whose husband he
      had rescued from death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln was the grandest figure of the fiercest civil war. He is the
      gentlest memory of our world.

    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      THE infidels of one age have often been the aureoled saints of the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      The destroyers of the old are the creators of the new.
    </p>
    <p>
      As time sweeps on the old passes away and the new in its turn becomes old.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in the intellectual world, as in the physical, decay and growth,
      and ever by the grave of buried age stand youth and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of intellectual progress is written in the lives of infidels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Political rights have been preserved by traitors, the liberty of mind by
      heretics.
    </p>
    <p>
      To attack the king was treason; to dispute the priest was blasphemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many centuries the sword and cross were allies. Together they attacked
      the rights of man. They defended each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      The throne and altar were twins&mdash;two vultures from the same egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      James I. said: "No bishop, no king." He might have added: "No cross, no
      crown." The king owned the bodies of men; the priest, the souls. One lived
      on taxes collected by force, the other on alms collected by fear&mdash;both
      robbers, both beggars.
    </p>
    <p>
      These robbers and these beggars controlled two worlds. The king made laws,
      the priest made creeds. Both obtained their authority from God, both were
      the agents of the Infinite.
    </p>
    <p>
      With bowed backs the people carried the burdens of one, and with wonder's
      open mouth received the dogmas of the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the people aspired to be free, they were crushed by the king, and every
      priest was a Herod who slaughtered the children of the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king ruled by force, the priest by fear, and both by both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king said to the people: "God made you peasants, and He made me king;
      He made you to labor, and me to enjoy; He made rags and hovels for you,
      robes and palaces for me. He made you to obey, and me to command. Such is
      the justice of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      And the priest said: "God made you ignorant and vile; He made me holy and
      wise; you are the sheep, I am the shepherd; your fleeces belong to me. If
      you do not obey me here, God will punish you now and torment you forever
      in another world. Such is the mercy of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      "You must not reason. Reason is a rebel. You must not contradict&mdash;contradiction
      is born of egotism; you must believe. He that hath ears to hear let him
      hear." Heaven was a question of ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately for us, there have been traitors and there have been heretics,
      blasphemers, thinkers, investigators, lovers of liberty, men of genius who
      have given their lives to better the condition of their fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be well enough here to ask the question: What is greatness?
    </p>
    <p>
      A great man adds to the sum of knowledge, extends the horizon of thought,
      releases souls from the Bastile of fear, crosses unknown and mysterious
      seas, gives new islands and new continents to the domain of thought, new
      constellations to the firmament of mind. A great man does not seek applause
      or place; he seeks for truth; he seeks the road to happiness, and what he
      ascertains he gives to others.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great man throws pearls before swine, and the swine are sometimes
      changed to men. If the great had always kept their pearls, vast multitudes
      would be barbarians now.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great man is a torch in the darkness, a beacon in superstition's night,
      an inspiration and a prophecy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Greatness is not the gift of majorities; it cannot be thrust upon any man;
      men cannot give it to another; they can give place and power, but not
      greatness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The place does not make the man, nor the sceptre the king. Greatness is
      from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great men are the heroes who have freed the bodies of men; they are
      the philosophers and thinkers who have given liberty to the soul; they are
      the poets who have transfigured the common and filled the lives of many
      millions with love and song.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are the artists who have covered the bare walls of weary life with
      the triumphs of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are the heroes who have slain the monsters of ignorance and fear, who
      have outgazed the Gorgon and driven the cruel gods from their thrones.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are the inventors, the discoverers, the great mechanics, the kings of
      the useful who have civilized this world.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the head of this heroic army, foremost of all, stands Voltaire, whose
      memory we are honoring tonight.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire! a name that excites the admiration of men, the malignity of
      priests. Pronounce that name in the presence of a clergyman, and you will
      find that you have made a declaration of war. Pronounce that name, and
      from the face of the priest the mask of meekness will fall, and from the
      mouth of forgiveness will pour a Niagara of vituperation and calumny. And
      yet Voltaire was the greatest man of his century, and did more to free the
      human race than any other of the sons of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday, the 21st of November, 1694, a babe was born&mdash;a babe so
      exceedingly frail that the breath hesitated about remaining, and the
      parents had him baptized as soon as possible. They were anxious to save
      the soul of this babe, and they knew that if death came before baptism the
      child would be doomed to an eternity of pain. They knew that God despised
      an unsprinkled child. The priest who, with a few drops of water, gave the
      name of Francois-Marie Arouet to this babe and saved his soul&mdash;little
      thought that before him, wrapped in many folds, weakly wailing, scarcely
      breathing, was the one destined to tear from the white throat of Liberty
      the cruel, murderous claws of the "Triumphant Beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      When Voltaire came to this "great stage of fools," his country had been
      Christianized&mdash;not civilized&mdash;for about fourteen hundred years.
      For a thousand years the religion of peace and good-will had been supreme.
      The laws had been given by Christian kings, and sanctioned by "wise and
      holy men." Under the benign reign of universal love, every court had its
      chamber of torture, and every priest relied on the thumb-screw and rack.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such had been the success of the blessed gospel that every science was an
      outcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      To speak your honest thoughts, to teach your fellow-men, to investigate
      for yourself, to seek the truth, these were all crimes, and the
      "holy-mother church" pursued the criminals with sword and flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The believers in a God of love&mdash;an infinite father&mdash;punished
      hundreds of offences with torture and death. Suspected persons were
      tortured to make them confess. Convicted persons were tortured to make
      them give the names of their accomplices. Under the leadership of the
      church, cruelty had become the only reforming power.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this blessed year, 1694, all authors were at the mercy of king and
      priest. The most of them were cast into prisons, impoverished by fines and
      costs, exiled or executed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little time that hangmen could snatch from professional duties was
      occupied in burning books.
    </p>
    <p>
      The courts of justice were traps, in which the innocent were caught. The
      judges were almost as malicious and cruel as though they had been bishops
      or saints. There was no trial by jury, and the rules of evidence allowed
      the conviction of the supposed criminal by the proof of suspicion or
      hearsay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The witnesses, being liable to be tortured, generally told what the judges
      wished to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The supernatural and the miraculous controlled the world. Everything was
      explained, but nothing was understood. The church was at the head. The
      sick bought from monks little amulets of consecrated paper. They did not
      send for a doctor, but for a priest, and the priest sold the diseased and
      the dying these magical amulets. These little pieces of paper with the
      help of some saint would cure diseases of every kind. If you would put one
      in a cradle, it would keep the child from being bewitched. If you would
      put one in the barn, the rats would not eat your corn. If you would keep
      one in the house, evil spirits would not enter your doors, and if you
      buried them in the fields, you would have good weather, the frost would be
      delayed, rain would come when needed, and abundant crops would bless your
      labor. The church insisted that all diseases could be cured in the name of
      God, and that these cures could be effected by prayers, exorcism, by
      touching bones of saints, pieces of the true cross; by being sprinkled
      with holy water or with sanctified salt, or touched with magical oil.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that day the dead saints were the best physicians; St. Valentine cured
      the epilepsy; St. Gervasius was exceedingly good for rheumatism; St.
      Michael for cancer; St. Judas for coughs and colds; St. Ovidius restored
      the hearing; St. Sebastian was good for the bites of snakes and the stings
      of poisonous insects; St. Apollonia for toothache; St. Clara for any
      trouble with the eyes; and St. Hubert for hydrophobia. It was known that
      doctors reduced the revenues of the church; that was enough&mdash;science
      was the enemy of religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church thought that the air was filled with devils; that every sinner
      was a kind of tenement house inhabited by evil spirits; that angels were
      on one side of men and evil spirits on the other, and that God would, when
      the subscriptions and donations justified the effort, drive the evil
      spirits from the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satan had power over the air; consequently he controlled the frost, the
      mildew, the lightning and the flood; and the principal business of the
      church was with bells, and holy water, and incense, and crosses, to defeat
      the machinations of that prince of the power of the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Great reliance was placed upon the bells; they were sprinkled with holy
      water, and their clangor cleared the air of imps and fiends. And bells
      also protected the people from storms and lightning. In that day the
      church used to anathematize insects. Suits were commenced against rats,
      and judgment rendered. Every monastery had its master magician, who sold
      incense and salt and tapers and consecrated palms and relics. Every
      science was regarded as an enemy; every fact held the creed of the church
      in scorn. Investigators were regarded as dangerous; thinkers were
      traitors, and the church exerted its vast power to prevent the
      intellectual progress of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no real liberty, no real education, no real philosophy, no real
      science&mdash;-nothing but credulity and superstition. The world was under
      the control of Satan and the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church firmly believed in the existence of witches and devils and
      fiends. In this way the church had every enemy within her power. It simply
      had to charge him with being a wizard, of holding communications with
      devils, and the ignorant mob were ready to tear him to pieces. So
      prevalent was this belief, this belief in the supernatural, that the poor
      people were finally driven to make the best possible terms they could with
      the spirit of evil. This frightful doctrine filled every friend with
      suspicion of his friend; it made the husband denounce the wife, children
      their parents, parents their children. It destroyed the amenities of
      humanity; it did away with justice in courts; it broke the bond of
      friendship; it filled with poison the golden cup of life; it turned earth
      into a very perdition peopled with abominable, malicious and hideous
      fiends. Such was the result of a belief in the supernatural; such was the
      result of giving up the evidence of their own senses and relying upon
      dreams, visions and fears. Such was the result of the attack upon the
      human reason; such the result of depending on the imagination, on the
      supernatural; such the result of living in this world for another; of
      depending upon priests instead of upon ourselves. The Protestants vied
      with Catholics; Luther stood side by side with the priests he had deserted
      in promoting this belief in devils and fiends. To the Catholic every
      Protestant was possessed by a devil; to the Protestant every Catholic was
      the home of a fiend. All order, all regular succession of causes and
      effects were known no more; the natural ceased to exist; the learned and
      the ignorant were on a level. The priest was caught in the net he had
      spread for the peasant, and Christendom became a vast madhouse, with the
      insane for keepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Voltaire was born the church ruled and owned France. It was a period
      of almost universal corruption. The priests were mostly libertines, the
      judges cruel and venal. The royal palace was a house of prostitution. The
      nobles were heartless, proud, arrogant and cruel to the last degree. The
      common people were treated as beasts. It took the church a thousand years
      to bring about this happy condition of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seeds of the Revolution unconsciously were being scattered by every
      noble and by every priest.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were germinating slowly in the hearts of the wretched; they were
      being watered by the tears of agony; blows began to bear interest. There
      was a faint longing for blood. Workmen, blackened by the sun, bowed by
      labor, deformed by want, looked at the white throats of scornful ladies
      and thought about cutting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days witnesses were cross-examined with instruments of torture;
      the church was the arsenal of superstition; miracles, relics, angels and
      devils were as common as lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to appreciate a great man we must know his surroundings. We must
      understand the scope of the drama in which he played&mdash;the part he
      acted, and we must also know his audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      In England George I. was disporting with the "May-pole" and "Elephant,"
      and then George II., jealous and choleric, hating the English and their
      language, making, however, an excellent image or idol before whom the
      English were glad to bow&mdash;snobbery triumphant&mdash;the criminal code
      getting bloodier every day&mdash;223 offences punishable with death&mdash;the
      prisons filled and the scaffolds crowded&mdash;efforts on every hand to
      repress the ambition of men to be men&mdash;the church relying on
      superstition and ceremony to make men good&mdash;and the state dependent
      on the whip, the rope and axe to make men patriotic.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Spain the Inquisition in full control&mdash;all the instruments of
      torture used to prevent the development of the mind, Spain, that had
      driven out the Jews, that is to say, her talent; that had driven out the
      Moors, that is to say, her taste and her industry, was still endeavoring
      by all religious means to reduce the land to the imbecility of the true
      faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Portugal they were burning women and children for having eaten meat on
      a holy day, and this to please the most merciful God.

      In Italy the nation prostrate, covered with swarms of cardinals and
      bishops and priests and monks and nuns and every representative of holy
      sloth. The Inquisition there also&mdash;while hands that were clasped in
      prayer or stretched for alms, grasped with eagerness and joy the lever of
      the rack, or gathered fagots for the holy flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Germany they were burning men and women charged with having made a
      compact with the enemy of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in our own fair land, persecuting Quakers, stealing men and women from
      another shore, stealing children from their mother's breasts, and paying
      labor with the cruel lash.
    </p>
    <p>
      Superstition ruled the world!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is but one use for law, but one excuse for government&mdash;the
      preservation of liberty&mdash;to give to each man his own, to secure to
      the farmer what he produces from the soil, the mechanic what he invents
      and makes, to the artist what he creates, to the thinker the right to
      express his thoughts. Liberty is the breath of progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      In France, the people were the sport of a king's caprice. Everywhere was
      the shadow of the Bastile.
    </p>
    <p>
      It fell upon the sunniest field, upon the happiest home. With the king
      walked the headsman; back of the throne was the chamber of torture. The
      Church appealed to the rack, and Faith relied on the fagot. Science was an
      outcast, and Philosophy, so-called, was the pander of superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobles and priests were sacred. Peasants were vermin. Idleness sat at the
      banquet, and Industry gathered the crumbs and the crusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. THE DAYS OF YOUTH.
    </p>
    <p>
      VOLTAIRE was of the people. In the language of that day, he had no
      ancestors. His real name was Francois-Marie Arouet. His mother was
      Marguerite d'Aumard. This mother died when he was seven years of age. He
      had an elder brother, Armand, who was a devotee, very religious and
      exceedingly disagreeable. This brother used to present offerings to the
      church, hoping to make amends for the unbelief of his brother. So far as
      we know, none of his ancestors were literary people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Arouets had never written a line. The Abbe de Chaulieu was his
      godfather, and, although an abbe, was a Deist who cared nothing about
      religion except in connection with his salary. Voltaire's father wanted to
      make a lawyer of him, but he had no taste for law. At the age of ten he
      entered the college of Louis Le Grand. This was a Jesuit school, and here
      he remained for seven years, leaving at seventeen, and never attending any
      other school. According to Voltaire, he learned nothing at this school but
      a little Greek, a good deal of Latin and a vast amount of nonsense.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this college of Louis Le Grand they did not teach geography, history,
      mathematics or any science. This was a Catholic institution, controlled by
      the Jesuits. In that day the religion was defended, was protected or
      supported by the state. Behind the entire creed were the bayonet, the axe,
      the wheel, the fagot and the torture chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Voltaire was attending the college of Louis Le Grand the soldiers of
      the king were hunting Protestants in the mountains of Cevennes for
      magistrates to hang on gibbets, to put to torture, to break on the wheel,
      or to burn at the stake.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seventeen Voltaire determined to devote his life to literature. The
      father said, speaking of his two sons Armand and Francois, "I have a pair
      of fools for sons, one in verse and the other in prose."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1713, Voltaire, in a small way, became a diplomat. He went to The Hague
      attached to the French minister, and there he fell in love. The girl's
      mother objected. Voltaire sent his clothes to the young lady that she
      might visit him. Everything was discovered and he was dismissed. To this
      girl he wrote a letter, and in it you will find the key note of Voltaire:
      "Do not expose yourself to the fury of your mother. You know what she is
      capable of. You have experienced it too well. Dissemble; it is your only
      chance. Tell her that you have forgotten me, that you hate me; then after
      telling her, love me all the more."
    </p>
    <p>
      On account of this episode Voltaire was formally disinherited by his
      father. The father procured an order of arrest and gave his son the choice
      of going to prison or beyond the seas. He finally consented to become a
      lawyer, and says: "I have already been a week at work in the office of a
      solicitor learning the trade of a pettifogger."
    </p>
    <p>
      About this time he competed for a prize, writing a poem on the king's
      generosity in building the new choir in the Cathedral Notre Dame. He did
      not win it. After being with the solicitor a little while, he hated the
      law, began to write poetry and the outlines of tragedy. Great questions
      were then agitating the public mind, questions that throw a flood of light
      upon that epoch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1552 Dr. Baius took it into his head to sustain a number of
      propositions touching predestination to the prejudice of the doctrine of
      free will. The Cordelian monks selected seventy-six of the propositions
      and denounced them to the Pope as heretical, and from the Pope obtained
      what was called a Bull. This Bull contained a doubtful passage, the
      meaning of which was dependent upon the position of a comma. The friends
      of Dr. Baius wrote to Rome to find where the comma ought to be placed.
      Rome, busy with other matter, sent as an answer a copy of the Bull in
      which the doubtful sentence was left without any comma. So the dispute
      continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was the great controversy between the Jansenists and Molinists.
      Molini was a Spanish Jesuit, who sustained the doctrine of free will with
      a subtlety of his own, "man's will is free, but God sees exactly how he
      will use it." The Presbyterians of our country are still wrestling with
      this important absurdity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jansenius was a French Jesuit who carried the doctrine of predestination
      to the extreme, asserting that God commands things that are impossible,
      and that Christ did not die for all.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1641 the Jesuits obtained a Bull condemning five propositions of
      Jansenius. The Jansenists there upon denied that the five propositions&mdash;or
      any of them&mdash;were found in the works of Jansenius.
    </p>
    <p>
      This question of Jansenism and Molinism occupied France for about two
      hundred years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Voltaire's time the question had finally dwindled down to whether the
      five propositions condemned by the Papal Bull were in fact in the works of
      Jansenius. The Jansenists proved that the five propositions were not in
      his book, because a niece of Pascal had a diseased eye cured by the
      application of a thorn from the crown of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bull Unigenitus was launched in 1713, and then all the prisons were
      filled with Jansenists. This great question of predestination and free
      will, of free moral agency and accountability, and being saved by the
      grace of God, and damned for the glory of God, have occupied the mind of
      what we call the civilized world for many centuries. All these questions
      were argued pro and con through Switzerland; all of them in Holland for
      centuries; in Scotland and England and New England, and millions of people
      are still busy harmonizing foreordination and free will, necessity and
      morality, predestination and accountability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Louis XIV. having died, the Regent took possession, and then the prisons
      were opened. The Regent called for a list of all persons then in the
      prisons sent there at the will of the king. He found that, as to many
      prisoners, nobody knew any cause why they had been in prison. They had
      been forgotten. Many of the prisoners did not know themselves, and could
      not guess why they had been arrested. One Italian had been in the Bastile
      thirty-three years without ever knowing why. On his arrival in Paris,
      thirty-three years before, he was arrested and sent to prison. He had
      grown old. He had survived his family and friends. When the rest were
      liberated he asked to remain where he was, and lived there the rest of his
      life. The old prisoners were pardoned, but in a little while their places
      were taken by new ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time Voltaire was not interested in the great world&mdash;knew
      very little of religion or of government. He was busy writing poetry, busy
      thinking of comedies and tragedies. He was full of life. All his fancies
      were winged like moths.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was charged with having written some cutting epigrams. He was exiled to
      Tulle, three hundred miles away. From this place he wrote in the true vein&mdash;"I
      am at a chateau, a place that would be the most agreeable in the world if
      I had not been exiled to it, and where there is nothing wanting for my
      perfect happiness except the liberty of leaving. It would be delicious to
      remain, if I only were allowed to go."
    </p>
    <p>
      At last the exile was allowed to return. Again he was arrested; this time
      sent to the Bastile, where he remained for nearly a year. While in prison
      he changed his name from Francois-Marie Arouet to Voltaire, and by that
      name he has since been known.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire, as full of life as summer is full of blossoms, giving his ideas
      upon all subjects at the expense of prince and king, was exiled to
      England. From sunny France he took his way to the mists and fogs of
      Albion. He became acquainted with the highest and the best in Britain. He
      met Pope, a most wonderful verbal mechanic, a maker of artificial flowers,
      very much like natural ones, except that they lack perfume and the seeds
      of suggestion. He made the acquaintance of Young, who wrote the "Night
      Thoughts;" Young, a fine old hypocrite with a virtuous imagination, a
      gentleman who electioneered with the king's mistress that he might be made
      a bishop. He became acquainted with Chesterfield&mdash;all manners, no
      man; with Thomson, author of "The Seasons," who loved to see the sun rise
      in bed and visit the country in town; with Swift, whose poisoned arrows
      were then festering in the flesh of Mr. Bull&mdash;Swift, as wicked as he
      was witty, and as heartless as he was humorous&mdash;with Swift, a dean
      and a devil; with Congreve, whom Addison thought superior to Shakespeare,
      and who never wrote but one great line, "The cathedral looking
      tranquillity."
    </p>
    <p>
      III. THE MORN OF MANHOOD.
    </p>
    <p>
      VOLTAIRE began to think, to doubt, to inquire. He studied the history of
      the church, of the creed. He found that the religion of his time rested on
      the inspiration of the Scriptures&mdash;the infallibility of the church&mdash;the
      dreams of insane hermits&mdash;the absurdities of the Fathers&mdash;the
      mistakes and falsehoods of saints&mdash;the hysteria of nuns&mdash;the
      cunning of priests and the stupidity of the people. He found that the
      Emperor Constantine, who lifted Christianity into power, murdered his wife
      Fausta and his eldest son Crispus, the same year that he convened the
      Council of Nice, to decide whether Christ was a man or the Son of God. The
      Council decided, in the year 325, that Christ was consubstantial with the
      Father. He found that the church was indebted to a husband who
      assassinated his wife&mdash;a father who murdered his son, for settling
      the vexed question of the divinity of the Savior. He found that Theodosius
      called a council at Constantinople in 381, by which it was decided that
      the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father&mdash;that Theodosius, the
      younger, assembled a council at Ephesus in 431, that declared the Virgin
      Mary to be the mother of God&mdash;that the Emperor Marcian called another
      council at Chalcedon in 451, that decided that Christ had two wills&mdash;that
      Pognatius called another in 680, that declared that Christ had two natures
      to go with his two wills&mdash;and that in 1274, at the council of Lyons,
      the important fact was found that the Holy Ghost "proceeded," not only
      from the Father, but also from the Son at the same time.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, it took about 1,300 years to find out a few things that had been
      revealed by an infinite God to his infallible church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire found that this insane creed had filled the world with cruelty
      and fear. He found that vestments were more sacred than virtues&mdash;that
      images and crosses&mdash;pieces of old bones and bits of wood were more
      precious than the rights and lives of men, and that the keepers of these
      relics were the enemies of the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      With all the energy of his nature&mdash;with every faculty of his mind&mdash;he
      attacked this "Triumphant Beast."
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire was the apostle of common sense. He knew that there could have
      been no primitive or first language from which all other languages had
      been formed. He knew that every language had been influenced by the
      surroundings of the people. He knew that the language of snow and ice was
      not the language of palm and flower. He knew also that there had been no
      miracle in language. He knew that it was impossible that the story of the
      Tower of Babel should be true. He knew that everything in the whole world
      had been natural. He was the enemy of alchemy, not only in language but in
      science. One passage from him is enough to show his philosophy in this
      regard. He says; "To transmute iron into gold, two things are necessary:
      first, the annihilation of the iron; second, the creation of gold."
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire gave us the philosophy of history.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire was a man of humor, of good nature, of cheerfulness. He despised
      with all his heart the philosophy of Calvin, the creed of the sombre, of
      the severe, of the unnatural. He pitied those who needed the aid of
      religion to be honest, to be cheerful. He had the courage to enjoy the
      present and the philosophy to bear what the future might bring.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet for more than a hundred and fifty years the Christian world has
      fought this man and has maligned his memory. In every Christian pulpit his
      name has been pronounced with scorn, and every pulpit has been an arsenal
      of slander. He is one man of whom no orthodox minister has ever told the
      truth. He has been denounced equally by Catholics and Protestants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Priests and ministers, bishops and exhorters, presiding elders and popes
      have filled the world with slanders, with calumnies about Voltaire. I am
      amazed that ministers will not or cannot tell the truth about an enemy of
      the church. As a matter of fact, for more than one thousand years, almost
      every pulpit has been a mint in which slanders have been coined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire made up his mind to destroy the superstition of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fought with every weapon that genius could devise or use. He was the
      greatest of all caricaturists, and he used this wonderful gift without
      mercy. For pure crystallized wit, he had no equal. The art of flattery was
      carried by him to the height of an exact science. He knew and practiced
      every subterfuge. He fought the army of hypocrisy and pretence, the army
      of faith and falsehood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire was annoyed by the meaner and baser spirits of his time, by the
      cringers and crawlers, by the fawners and pretenders, by those who wished
      to gain the favor of priests, the patronage of nobles. Sometimes he
      allowed himself to be annoyed by these wretches; sometimes he attacked
      them. And, but for these attacks, long ago they would have been forgotten.
      In the amber of his genius Voltaire preserved these insects, these
      tarantulas, these scorpions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is fashionable to say that he was not profound. This is because he was
      not stupid. In the presence of absurdity he laughed, and was called
      irreverent. He thought God would not damn even a priest forever&mdash;this
      was regarded as blasphemy. He endeavored to prevent Christians from
      murdering each other, and did what he could to civilize the disciples of
      Christ. Had he founded a sect, obtained control of some country, and
      burned a few heretics at slow fires, he would have won the admiration,
      respect and love of the Christian world. Had he only pretended to believe
      all the fables of antiquity, had he mumbled Latin prayers, counted beads,
      crossed himself, devoured now and then the flesh of God, and carried
      fagots to the feet of Philosophy in the name of Christ, he might have been
      in heaven this moment, enjoying a sight of the damned.
    </p>
    <p>
      If he had only adopted the creed of his time&mdash;if he had asserted that
      a God of infinite power and mercy had created millions and billions of
      human beings to suffer eternal pain, and all for the sake of his glorious
      justice&mdash;that he had given his power of attorney to a cunning and
      cruel Italian Pope, authorizing him to save the soul of his mistress and
      send honest wives to hell&mdash;if he had given to the nostril's of this
      God the odor of burning flesh&mdash;the incense of the fagot&mdash;if he
      had filled his ears with the shrieks of the tortured&mdash;the music of
      the rack, he would now be known as Saint Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years this restless man filled Europe with the product of his
      brain. Essays, epigrams, epics, comedies, tragedies, histories, poems,
      novels, representing every phase and every faculty of the human mind. At
      the same time engrossed in business, full of speculation, making money
      like a millionaire, busy with the gossip of courts, and even with the
      scandals of priests. At the same time alive to all the discoveries of
      science and the theories of philosophers, and in this Babel never
      forgetting for one moment to assail the monster of superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sleeping and waking he hated the church. With the eyes of Argus he
      watched, and with the arms of Briareus he struck. For sixty years he waged
      continuous and unrelenting war, sometimes in the open field, sometimes
      striking from the hedges of opportunity&mdash;taking care during all this
      time to remain independent of all men. He was in the highest sense
      successful. He lived like a prince, became one of the powers of Europe,
      and in him, for the first time, literature was crowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been claimed by the Christian critics that Voltaire was irreverent;
      that he examined sacred things without solemnity; that he refused to
      remove his shoes in the presence of the Burning Bush; that he smiled at
      the geology of Moses, the astronomical ideas of Joshua, and that the
      biography of Jonah filled him with laughter. They say that these stories,
      these sacred impossibilities, these inspired falsehoods, should be read
      and studied with a believing mind in humbleness of spirit; that they
      should be examined prayerfully, asking God at the same time to give us
      strength to triumph over the conclusions of our reason. These critics
      imagine that a falsehood can be old enough to be venerable, and that to
      stand covered in its presence is the act of an irreverent scoffer.
      Voltaire approached the mythology of the Jews precisely as he did the
      mythology of the Greeks and Romans, or the mythology of the Chinese or the
      Iroquois Indians. There is nothing in this world too sacred to be
      investigated, to be understood. The philosopher does not hide. Secrecy is
      not the friend of truth. No man should be reverent at the expense of his
      reason. Nothing should be worshiped until the reason has been convinced
      that it is worthy of worship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against all miracles, against all holy superstition, against sacred
      mistakes, he shot the arrows of ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      These arrows, winged by fancy, sharpened by wit, poisoned by truth, always
      reached the centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is claimed by many that anything, the best and holiest, can be
      ridiculed. As a matter of fact, he who attempts to ridicule the truth,
      ridicules himself. He becomes the food of his own laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mind of man is many-sided. Truth must be and is willing to be tested
      in every way, tested by all the senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in what way can the absurdity of the "real presence" be answered,
      except by banter, by raillery, by ridicule, by persiflage? How are you
      going to convince a man who believes that when he swallows the sacred
      wafer he has eaten the entire Trinity, and that a priest drinking a drop
      of wine has devoured the Infinite? How are you to reason with a man who
      believes that if any of the sacred wafers are left over they should be put
      in a secure place, so that mice should not eat God?
    </p>
    <p>
      What effect will logic have upon a religious gentleman who firmly believes
      that a God of infinite compassion sent two bears to tear thirty or forty
      children in pieces for laughing at a bald-headed prophet?
    </p>
    <p>
      How are such people to be answered? How can they be brought to a sense of
      their absurdity? They must feel in their flesh the arrows of ridicule..
    </p>
    <p>
      So Voltaire has been called a mocker.
    </p>
    <p>
      What did he mock? He mocked kings that were unjust; kings who cared
      nothing for the sufferings of their subjects. He mocked the titled fools
      of his day. He mocked the corruption of courts; the meanness, the tyranny
      and the brutality of judges. He mocked the absurd and cruel laws, the
      barbarous customs. He mocked popes and cardinals and bishops and priests,
      and all the hypocrites on the earth. He mocked historians who filled their
      books with lies, and philosophers who defended superstition. He mocked the
      haters of liberty, the persecutors of their fellow-men. He mocked the
      arrogance, the cruelty, the impudence, and the unspeakable baseness of his
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has been blamed because he used the weapon of ridicule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hypocrisy has always hated laughter, and always will. Absurdity detests
      humor, and stupidity despises wit. Voltaire was the master of ridicule. He
      ridiculed the absurd, the impossible. He ridiculed the mythologies and the
      miracles, the stupid lives and lies of the saints. He found pretence and
      mendacity crowned by credulity. He found the ignorant many controlled by
      the cunning and cruel few. He found the historian, saturated with
      superstition, filling his volumes with the details of the impossible, and
      he found the scientists satisfied with "they say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire had the instinct of the probable. He knew the law of average, the
      sea level; he had the idea of proportion, and so he ridiculed the mental
      monstrosities and deformities&mdash;the <i>non sequiturs</i>&mdash;of his
      day. Aristotle said women had more teeth than men. This was repeated again
      and again by the Catholic scientists of the eighteenth century.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire counted the teeth. The rest were satisfied with "they say."
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire for many years, in spite of his surroundings, in spite of almost
      universal tyranny and oppression, was a believer in God and what he was
      pleased to call the religion of Nature. He attacked the creed of his time
      because it was dishonorable to his God. He thought of the Deity as a
      father, as the fountain of justice, intelligence and mercy, and the creed
      of the Catholic Church made him a monster of cruelty and stupidity. He
      attacked the Bible with all the weapons at his command. He assailed its
      geology, its astronomy, its ideas of justice, its laws and customs, its
      absurd and useless miracles, its foolish wonders, its ignorance on all
      subjects, its insane prophecies, its cruel threats and its extravagant
      promises.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time he praised the God of nature, the God who gives us rain
      and light and food and flowers and health and happiness&mdash;who fills
      the world with youth and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attacked on every side, he fought with every weapon that wit, logic,
      reason, scorn, contempt, laughter, pathos and indignation could sharpen,
      form, devise or use. He often apologized, and the apology was an insult.
      He often recanted, and the recantation was a thousand times worse than the
      thing recanted. He took it back by giving more. In the name of eulogy he
      flayed his victim. In his praise there was poison. He often advanced by
      retreating, and asserted by retraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not intend to give priests the satisfaction of seeing him burn or
      suffer. Upon this very point of recanting he wrote:
    </p>
    <p>
      "They say I must retract. Very willingly. I will declare that Pascal is
      always right. That if St. Luke and St. Mark contradict one another, it is
      only another proof of the truth of religion to those who know how to
      understand such things; and that another lovely proof of religion is that
      it is unintelligible. I will even avow that all priests are gentle and
      disinterested; that Jesuits are honest people; that monks are neither
      proud nor given to intrigue, and that their odor is agreeable; that the
      Holy Inquisition is the triumph of humanity and tolerance. In a word, I
      will say all that may be desired of me, provided they leave me in repose,
      and will not persecute a man who has done harm to none."
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave the best years of his wondrous life to succor the oppressed, to
      shield the defenceless, to reverse infamous decrees, to rescue the
      innocent, to reform the laws of France, to do away with torture, to soften
      the hearts of priests, to enlighten judges, to instruct kings, to civilize
      the people, and to banish from the heart of man the love and lust of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may think that I have said too much; that I have placed this man too
      high. Let me tell you what Goethe, the great German, said of this man:
    </p>
    <p>
      "If you wish depth, genius, imagination, taste, reason, sensibility,
      philosophy, elevation, originality, nature, intellect, fancy, rectitude,
      facility, flexibility, precision, art, abundance, variety, fertility,
      warmth, magic, charm, grace, force, an eagle sweep of vision, vast
      understanding, instruction rich, tone excellent, urbanity, suavity,
      delicacy, correctness, purity, clearness, eloquence, harmony, brilliancy,
      rapidity, gaiety, pathos, sublimity and universality, perfection indeed,
      behold Voltaire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Even Carlyle, that old Scotch terrier, with the growl of a grizzly bear,
      who attacked shams, as I have sometimes thought, because he hated rivals,
      was forced to admit that Voltaire gave the death stab to modern
      superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the duty of every man to destroy the superstitions of his time, and
      yet there are thousands of men and women, fathers and mothers, who
      repudiate with their whole hearts the creeds of superstition, and still
      allow their children to be taught these lies. They allow their
      imaginations to be poisoned with the dogma of eternal pain. They allow
      arrogant and ignorant parsons, meek and foolish teachers, to sow the seeds
      of barbarism in the minds of their children&mdash;seeds that will fill
      their lives with fear and pain. Nothing can be more important to a human
      being than to be free and to live without fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is far better to be a mortal free man than an immortal slave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fathers and mothers should do their utmost to make their children free.
      They should teach them to doubt, to investigate, to inquire, and every
      father and mother should know that by the cradle of every child, as by the
      cradle of the infant Hercules, crawls the serpent of superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV. THE SCHEME OF NATURE.
    </p>
    <p>
      AT that time it was pretended by the believers in God that the plan, or
      the scheme of nature, was not cruel; that the lower was sacrificed for the
      benefit of the higher; that while life lived upon life, while animals
      lived upon each other, and while man was the king or sovereign of all,
      still the higher lived upon the lower. Consequently, a lower life was
      sacrificed that a higher life might exist. This reasoning satisfied many.
      Yet there were thousands that could not see why the lower should be
      sacrificed, or why all joy should be born of pain. But, since the
      construction of the microscope, since man has been allowed to look toward
      the infinitely small, as well as toward the infinitely great, he finds
      that our fathers were mistaken when they laid down the proposition that
      only the lower life was sacrificed for the sake of the higher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we find that the lives of all visible animals are liable to be, and in
      countless cases are, destroyed by a far lower life; that man himself is
      destroyed by the microbes, the bacilli, the infinitesimal. We find that
      for the sake of preserving the yellow fever germs millions and millions
      have died, and that whole nations have been decimated for the sake of the
      little beast that gives us the cholera. We have also found that there are
      animals, call them what you please, that live on the substance of the
      human heart, others that prefer the lungs, others again so delicate in
      their palate that they insist on devouring the optic nerve, and when they
      have destroyed the sight of one eye have sense enough to bore through the
      cartilage of the nose to attack the other. Thus we find the other side of
      this proposition. At first sight the lower seemed to be sacrificed for the
      sake of the higher, but on closer inspection the highest are sacrificed
      for the sake of the lowest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire was, for a long time, a believer in the optimism of Pope&mdash;"All
      partial evil, universal good." This is a very fine philosophy for the
      fortunate. It suits the rich. It is flattering to kings and priests. It
      sounds well. It is a fine stone to throw at a beggar. It enables you to
      bear with great fortitude the misfortunes of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not the philosophy for those who suffer&mdash;for industry clothed
      in rags, for patriotism in prison, for honesty in want, or for virtuous
      outcasts. It is a philosophy of a class, of a few, and of the few who are
      fortunate; and, when misfortune overtakes them, this philosophy fades and
      withers.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1755 came the earthquake at Lisbon. This frightful disaster became an
      immense interrogation. The optimist was compelled to ask, "What was my God
      doing? Why did the Universal Father crush to shapelessness thousands of
      his poor children, even at the moment when they were upon their knees
      returning thanks to him?"
    </p>
    <p>
      What could be done with this horror? If earthquake there must be, why did
      it not occur in some uninhabited desert, on some wide waste of sea? This
      frightful fact changed the theology of Voltaire. He became convinced that
      this is not the best possible of all worlds. He became convinced that evil
      is evil here, now, and forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Theist was silent. The earthquake denied the existence of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      V. HIS HUMANITY.
    </p>
    <p>
      TOULOUSE was a favored town. It was rich in relics. The people were as
      ignorant as wooden images, but they had in their possession the dried
      bodies of seven apostles&mdash;the bones of many of the infants slain by
      Herod&mdash;part of a dress of the Virgin Mary, and lots of skulls and
      skeletons of the infallible idiots known as saints.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this city the people celebrated every year with great joy two holy
      events: The expulsion of the Huguenots, and the blessed massacre of St.
      Bartholomew. The citizens of Toulouse had been educated and civilized by
      the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few Protestants, mild because in the minority, lived among these jackals
      and tigers.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of these Protestants was Jean Calas&mdash;a small dealer in dry goods.
      For forty years he had been in this business, and his character was
      without a stain. He was honest, kind and agreeable. He had a wife and six
      children&mdash;four sons and two daughters. One of the sons became a
      Catholic. The eldest son, Marc Antoine, disliked his father's business and
      studied law. He could not be allowed to practice unless he became a
      Catholic. He tried to get his license by concealing that he was a
      Protestant. He was discovered&mdash;grew morose. Finally he became
      discouraged and committed suicide, by hanging himself one evening in his
      father's store.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bigots of Toulouse started the story that his parents had killed him
      to prevent his becoming a Catholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this frightful charge the father, mother, one son, a servant, and one
      guest at their house, were arrested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dead son was considered a martyr, the church taking possession of the
      body.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happened in 1761.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was what was called a trial. There was no evidence, not the
      slightest, except hearsay. All the facts were in favor of the accused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The united strength of the defendants could not have done the deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jean Calas was doomed to torture and to death upon the wheel. This was on
      the 9th of March, 1762, and the sentence was to be carried out the next
      day.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 10th the father was taken to the torture room. The
      executioner and his assistants were sworn on the cross to administer the
      torture according to the judgment of the court.
    </p>
    <p>
      They bound him by the wrists to an iron ring in the stone wall four feet
      from the ground, and his feet to another ring in the floor. Then they
      shortened the ropes and chains until every joint in his arms and legs was
      dislocated. Then he was questioned. He declared that he was innocent. Then
      the ropes were again shortened until life fluttered in the torn body; but
      he remained firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was called "the question ordinaire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the magistrates exhorted the victim to confess, and again he
      refused, saying that there was nothing to confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came "the question extraordinaire."
    </p>
    <p>
      Into the mouth of the victim was placed a horn holding three pints of
      water. In this way thirty pints of water were forced into the body of the
      sufferer. The pain was beyond description, and yet Jean Calas remained
      firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was then carried to the scaffold in a tumbril.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was bound to a wooden cross that lay on the scaffold. The executioner
      then took a bar of iron, broke each leg and each arm in two places,
      striking eleven blows in all. He was then left to die if he could. He
      lived for two hours, declaring his innocence to the last. He was slow to
      die, and so the executioner strangled him. Then his poor lacerated,
      bleeding and broken body was chained to a stake and burned.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this was a spectacle&mdash;a festival for the savages of Toulouse.
      What would they have done if their hearts had not been softened by the
      glad tidings of great joy&mdash;peace on earth and good will to men?
    </p>
    <p>
      But this was not all. The property of the family was confiscated; the son
      was released on condition that he become a Catholic; the servant if she
      would enter a convent. The two daughters were consigned to a convent, and
      the heart-broken widow was allowed to wander where she would.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire heard of this case. In a moment his soul was on fire. He took one
      of the sons under his roof. He wrote a history of the case. He
      corresponded with kings and queens, with chancellors and lawyers. If money
      was needed, he advanced it. For years he filled Europe with the echoes of
      the groans of Jean Calas. He succeeded. The horrible judgment was annulled&mdash;the
      poor victim declared innocent and thousands of dollars raised to support
      the mother and family.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the work of Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE SIRVEN FAMILY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sirven, a Protestant, lived in Languedoc with his wife and three
      daughters. The housekeeper of the bishop wanted to make one of the
      daughters a Catholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The law allowed the bishop to take the child of Protestants from their
      parents for the sake of its soul. This little girl was so taken and placed
      in a convent. She ran away and came back to her parents. Her poor little
      body was covered with the marks of the convent whip.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Suffer little children to come unto me."
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was out of her mind&mdash;suddenly she disappeared, and a few
      days after her little body was found in a well, three miles from home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry was raised that her folks had murdered her to keep her from
      becoming a Catholic.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happened only a little way from the Christian City of Toulouse while
      Jean Calas was in prison. The Sirvens knew that a trial would end in
      conviction. They fled. In their absence they were convicted, their
      property confiscated, the parents sentenced to die by the hangman, the
      daughters to be under the gallows during the execution of their mother,
      and then to be exiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family fled in the midst of winter; the married daughter gave birth to
      a child in the snows of the Alps; the mother died, and, at last reaching
      Switzerland, the father found himself without means of support.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went to Voltaire. He espoused their cause. He took care of them, gave
      them the means to live, and labored to annul the sentence that had been
      pronounced against them for nine long and weary years. He appealed to
      kings for money, to Catharine II. of Russia, and to hundreds of others. He
      was successful. He said of this case: The Sirvens were tried and condemned
      in two hours in January, 1762, and now in January, 1772, after ten years
      of effort, they have been restored to their rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the work of Voltaire. Why should the worshipers of God hate the
      lovers of men?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE ESPENASSE CASE.
    </p>
    <p>
      Espenasse was a Protestant, of good estate. In 1740 he received into his
      house a Protestant clergyman, to whom he gave supper and lodging.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a country where priests repeated the parable of the "Good Samaritan,"
      this was a crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this crime Espenasse was tried, convicted and sentenced to the galleys
      for life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he had been imprisoned for twenty-three years his case came to the
      knowledge of Voltaire, and he was, through the efforts of Voltaire,
      released and restored to his family.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the work of Voltaire. There is not time to tell of the case of
      General Lally, of the English General Byng, of the niece of Corneille, of
      the Jesuit Adam, of the writers, dramatists, actors, widows and orphans
      for whose benefit he gave his influence, his money and his time. But I
      will tell another case:
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1765, at the town of Abbeville, an old wooden cross on a bridge had
      been mutilated&mdash;whittled with a knife&mdash;a terrible crime. Sticks,
      when crossing each other, were far more sacred than flesh and blood. Two
      young men were suspected&mdash;the Chevalier de la Barre and D'Etallonde.
      D'Etallonde fled to Prussia and enlisted as a common soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      La Barre remained and stood his trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was convicted without the slightest evidence, and he and D'Etallonde
      were both sentenced:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>First</i>, to endure the torture, ordinary and extraordinary.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Second</i>, to have their tongues torn out by the roots with pincers of
      iron.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Third</i>, to have their right hands cut off at the door of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Fourth</i>, to be bound to stakes by chains of iron and burned to death
      by a slow fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."
    </p>
    <p>
      Remembering this, the judges mitigated the sentence by providing that
      their heads should be cut off before their bodies were given to the
      flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      The case was appealed to Paris; heard by a court composed of twenty-five
      judges, learned in the law, and the judgment was confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sentence was carried out on the first day of July, 1766.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Voltaire heard of this judicial infamy he made up his mind to abandon
      France. He wished to leave forever a country where such cruelties were
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote a pamphlet, giving the history of the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ascertained the whereabouts of D'Etallonde, wrote in his behalf to the
      King of Prussia; got him released from the army; took him to his own
      house; kept him for a year and a half; saw that he was instructed in
      drawing, mathematics, engineering, and had at last the happiness of seeing
      him a captain of engineers in the army of Frederick the Great.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such a man was Voltaire. He was the champion of the oppressed and the
      helpless. He was the C&aelig;sar to whom the victims of church and state
      appealed. He stood for the intellect and heart of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet for a hundred and fifty years those who love their enemies have
      exhausted the vocabulary of hate, the ingenuity of malice and mendacity,
      in their efforts to save their stupid creeds from the genius of Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      From a great height he surveyed the world. His horizon was large. He had
      some vices&mdash;these he shared in common with priests&mdash;his virtues
      were his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was in favor of universal education&mdash;of the development of the
      brain. The church despised him. He wished to put the knowledge of the
      whole world within the reach of all. Every priest was his enemy. He wished
      to drive from the gate of Eden the cherubim of superstition, so that the
      children of Adam might return and eat of the fruit of the tree of
      knowledge. The church opposed this because it had the fruit of the tree of
      ignorance for sale.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was one of the foremost friends of the Encyclopedia&mdash;of Diderot,
      and did all in his power to give information to all. So far as principles
      were concerned, he was the greatest lawyer of his time. I do not mean that
      he knew the terms and decisions, but that he clearly perceived not only
      what the law should be, but its application and administration. He
      understood the philosophy of evidence, the difference between suspicion
      and proof, between belief and knowledge, and he did more to reform the
      laws of the kingdom and the abuses at courts than all the lawyers and
      statesmen of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      At school, he read and studied the works of Cicero&mdash;the lord of
      language&mdash;probably the greatest orator that has uttered speech, and
      the words of the Roman remained in his brain. He became, in spite of the
      spirit of caste, a believer in the equality of men. He said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Men are born equal."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us respect virtue and merit."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let us have it in the heart that men are equal." He was an abolitionist&mdash;the
      enemy of slavery in all its forms. He did not think that the color of one
      man gave him the right to steal from another man on account of that man's
      color. He was the friend of serf and peasant, and did what he could to
      protect animals, wives and children from the fury of those who loved their
      neighbors as themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Voltaire who sowed the seeds of liberty in the heart and brain of
      Franklin, of Jefferson and Thomas Paine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pufendorf had taken the ground that slavery was, in part, founded on
      contract.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire said: "Show me the contract, and if it is signed by the party to
      be the slave, I may believe."
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought it absurd that God should drown the fathers, and then come and
      die for the children. This is as good as the remark of Diderot: "If Christ
      had the power to defend himself from the Jews and refused to use it, he
      was guilty of suicide."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had sense enough to know that the flame of the fagot does not enlighten
      the mind. He hated the cruel and pitied the victims of church and state.
      He was the friend of the unfortunate&mdash;the helper of the striving. He
      laughed at the pomp of kings&mdash;the pretensions of priests. He was a
      believer in the natural and abhorred with all his heart the miraculous and
      absurd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire was not a saint. He was educated by the Jesuits. He was never
      troubled about the salvation of his soul. All the theological disputes
      excited his laughter, the creeds his pity, and the conduct of bigots his
      contempt. He was much better than a saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the Christians in his day kept their religion not for every day
      use but for disaster, as ships carry life boats to be used only in the
      stress of storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire believed in the religion of humanity&mdash;of good and generous
      deeds. For many centuries the church had painted virtue so ugly, sour and
      cold, that vice was regarded as beautiful. Voltaire taught the beauty of
      the useful, the hatefulness and hideousness of superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was not the greatest of poets, or of dramatists, but he was the
      greatest man of his time, the greatest friend of freedom and the deadliest
      foe of superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did more to break the chains of superstition&mdash;to drive the
      phantoms of fear from the heart and brain, to destroy the authority of the
      church and to give liberty to the world than any other of the sons of men.
      In the highest, the holiest sense he was the most profoundly religious man
      of his time.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI. THE RETURN.
    </p>
    <p>
      AFTER an exile of twenty-seven years, occupying during all that time a
      first place in the civilized world, Voltaire returned to Paris. His
      journey was a triumphal march. He was received as a conqueror. The
      Academy, the Immortals, came to meet him&mdash;a compliment that had never
      been paid to royalty. His tragedy of "Irene" was performed. At the theatre
      he was crowned with laurel, covered with flowers; he was intoxicated with
      perfume and with incense of worship. He was the supreme French poet,
      standing above them all. Among the literary men of the world he stood
      first&mdash;a monarch by the divine right of genius. There were three
      mighty forces in France&mdash;the throne, the altar and Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king was the enemy of Voltaire. The court could have nothing to do
      with him. The church, malign and morose, was waiting for her revenge, and
      yet, such was the reputation of this man&mdash;such the hold he had upon
      the people&mdash;that he became, in spite of Throne, in spite of Church,
      the idol of France.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an old man of eighty-four. He had been surrounded with the
      comforts, the luxuries of life. He was a man of great wealth, the richest
      writer that the world had known. Among the literary men of the earth he
      stood first. He was an intellectual king&mdash;one who had built his own
      throne and had woven the purple of his own power. He was a man of genius.
      The Catholic God had allowed him the appearance of success. His last years
      were filled with the intoxication of flattery&mdash;of almost worship. He
      stood at the summit of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests became anxious. They began to fear that God would forget, in a
      multiplicity of business, to make a terrible example of Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards the last of May, 1778, it was whispered in Paris that Voltaire was
      dying. Upon the fences of expectation gathered the unclean birds of
      superstition, impatiently waiting for their prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two days before his death, his nephew went to seek the Cur&eacute; of
      Saint Sulpice and the Abb&eacute; Gautier, and brought them into his
      uncle's sick chamber. 'Ah, well!' said Voltaire, 'give them my compliments
      and my thanks.' The Abb&eacute; spoke some words to him, exhorting him to
      patience. The cur&eacute; of Saint Sulpice then came forward, having
      announced himself, and asked of Voltaire, elevating his voice, if he
      acknowledged the divinity of our Lord Jesus Christ. The sick man pushed
      one of his hands against the cur&eacute;s coif, shoving him back and
      cried, turning abruptly to the other side, 'Let me die in peace.' The cur&eacute;
      seemingly considered his person soiled and his coif dishonored by the
      touch of a philosopher. He made the nurse give him a little brushing and
      went out with the Abb&eacute; Gautier."
    </p>
    <p>
      He expired, says Wagni&egrave;re, on the 30th of May, 1778, at about a
      quarter-past eleven at night, with the most perfect tranquillity. A few
      minutes before his last breath he took the hand of Morand, his <i>valet de
      chambre</i>, who was watching by him, pressed it, and said: "Adieu, my
      dear Morand, I am gone." These were his last words. Like a peaceful river
      with green and shaded banks, he flowed without a murmur into the waveless
      sea, where life is rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this death, so simple and serene, so kind, so philosophic and tender,
      so natural and peaceful; from these words, so utterly destitute of cant or
      dramatic touch, all the frightful pictures, all the despairing utterances,
      have been drawn and made. From these materials, and from these alone, or
      rather, in spite of these facts, have been constructed by priests and
      clergymen and their dupes all the shameless lies about the death of this
      great and wonderful man. A man, compared with whom all of his
      calumniators, dead and living, were, and are, but dust and vermin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us be honest. Did all the priests of Rome increase the mental wealth
      of man as much as Bruno? Did all the priests of France do as great a work
      for the civilization of the world as Voltaire or Diderot? Did all the
      ministers of Scotland add as much to the sum of human knowledge as David
      Hume? Have all the clergymen, monks, friars, ministers, priests, bishops,
      cardinals and popes, from the day of Pentecost to the last election, done
      as much for human liberty as Thomas Paine?
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the world be if infidels had never been?
    </p>
    <p>
      The infidels have been the brave and thoughtful men; the flower of all the
      world; the pioneers and heralds of the blessed day of liberty and love;
      the generous spirits of the unworthy past; the seers and prophets of our
      race; the great chivalric souls, proud victors on the battlefields of
      thought, the creditors of all the years to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should it be taken for granted that the men who devoted their lives to
      the liberation of their fellow-men should have been hissed at in the hour
      of death by the snakes of conscience, while men who defended slavery&mdash;practiced
      polygamy&mdash;-justified the stealing of babes from the breasts of
      mothers, and lashed the naked back of unpaid labor, are supposed to have
      passed smilingly from earth to the embraces of the angels? Why should we
      think that the brave thinkers, the investigators, the honest men, must
      have left the crumbling shore of time in dread and fear, while the
      instigators of the massacre of St. Bartholomew; the inventors and users of
      thumb-screws, of iron boots and racks; the burners and tearers of human
      flesh; the stealers, the whippers and the enslavers of men; the buyers and
      beaters of maidens, mothers and babes; the founders of the Inquisition;
      the makers of chains; the builders of dungeons; the calumniators of the
      living; the slanderers of the dead, and even the murderers of Jesus
      Christ, all died in the odor of sanctity, with white, forgiven hands
      folded upon the breasts of peace, while the destroyers of prejudice, the
      apostles of humanity, the soldiers of liberty, the breakers of fetters,
      the creators of light, died surrounded by the fierce fiends of God?
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days the philosophers&mdash;that is to say, the thinkers&mdash;were
      not buried in holy ground. It was feared that their principles might
      contaminate the ashes of the just. And they also feared that on the
      morning of the resurrection they might, in a moment of confusion, slip
      into heaven. Some were burned, and their ashes scattered; and the bodies
      of some were thrown naked to beasts, and others buried in unholy earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire knew the history of Adrienne Le Couvreur, a beautiful actress,
      denied burial.
    </p>
    <p>
      After all, we do feel an interest in what is to become of our bodies.
      There is a modesty that belongs to death. Upon this subject Voltaire was
      infinitely sensitive. It was that he might be buried that he went through
      the farce of confession, of absolution, and of the last sacrament. The
      priests knew that he was not in earnest, and Voltaire knew that they would
      not allow him to be buried in any of the cemeteries of Paris.
    </p>
    <p>
      His death was kept a secret. The Abb&eacute; Mignot made arrangements for
      the burial at Romilli-on-the-Seine, more than 100 miles from Paris. On
      Sunday evening, on the last day of May, 1778, the body of Voltaire, clad
      in a dressing gown, clothed to resemble an invalid, posed to simulate
      life, was placed in a carriage; at its side, a servant, whose business it
      was to keep it in position. To this carriage were attached six horses, so
      that people might think a great lord was going to his estates. Another
      carriage followed, in which were a grand nephew and two cousins of
      Voltaire. All night they traveled, and on the following day arrived at the
      courtyard of the Abbey. The necessary papers were shown, the mass was
      performed in the presence of the body, and Voltaire found burial. A few
      moments afterwards, the prior, who "for charity had given a little earth,"
      received from his bishop a menacing letter forbidding the burial of
      Voltaire. It was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire was dead. The foundations of State and Throne had been sapped.
      The people were becoming acquainted with the real kings and with the
      actual priests. Unknown men born in misery and want, men whose fathers and
      mothers had been pavement for the rich, were rising toward the light, and
      their shadowy faces were emerging from darkness. Labor and thought became
      friends. That is, the gutter and the attic fraternized. The monsters of
      the Night and the angels of the Dawn&mdash;the first thinking of revenge,
      and the others dreaming of equality, liberty and fraternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      VII. THE DEATH-BED ARGUMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL kinds of criminals, except infidels, meet death with reasonable
      serenity. As a rule, there is nothing in the death of a pirate to cast any
      discredit on his profession. The murderer upon the scaffold, with a priest
      on either side, smilingly exhorts the multitude to meet him in heaven. The
      man who has succeeded in making his home a hell, meets death without a
      quiver, provided he has never expressed any doubt as to the divinity of
      Christ, or the eternal "procession" of the Holy Ghost. The king who has
      waged cruel and useless war, who has filled countries with widows and
      fatherless children, with the maimed and diseased, and who has succeeded
      in offering to the Moloch of ambition the best and bravest of his
      subjects, dies like a saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the believing kings are in heaven&mdash;all the doubting philosophers
      in perdition. All the persecutors sleep in peace, and the ashes of those
      who burned their brothers, sleep in consecrated ground. Libraries could
      hardly contain the names of the Christian wretches who have filled the
      world with violence and death in defence of book and creed, and yet they
      all died the death of the righteous, and no priest, no minister, describes
      the agony and fear, the remorse and horror with which their guilty souls
      were filled in the last moments of their lives. These men had never
      doubted&mdash;they had never thought&mdash;they accepted the creed as they
      did the fashion of their clothes. They were not infidels, they could not
      be&mdash;they had been baptized, they had not denied the divinity of
      Christ, they had partaken of the "last supper." They respected priests,
      they admitted that Christ had two natures and the same number of wills;
      they admitted that the Holy Ghost had "proceeded," and that, according to
      the multiplication table of heaven, once one is three, and three times one
      is one, and these things put pillows beneath their heads and covered them
      with the drapery of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      They admitted that while kings and priests did nothing worse than to make
      their fellows wretched, that so long as they only butchered and burnt the
      innocent and helpless, God would maintain the strictest neutrality; but
      when some honest man, some great and tender soul, expressed a doubt as to
      the truth of the Scriptures, or prayed to the wrong God, or to the right
      one by the wrong name, then the real God leaped like a wounded tiger upon
      his victim, and from his quivering flesh tore his wretched soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no recorded instance where the uplifted hand of murder has been
      paralyzed&mdash;no truthful account in all the literature of the world of
      the innocent child being shielded by God. Thousands of crimes are being
      committed every day&mdash;men are at this moment lying in wait for their
      human prey&mdash;wives are whipped and crushed, driven to insanity and
      death&mdash;little children begging for mercy, lifting imploring,
      tear-filled eyes to the brutal faces of fathers and mothers&mdash;sweet
      girls are deceived, lured and outraged, but God has no time to prevent
      these things&mdash;no time to defend the good and protect the pure. He is
      too busy numbering hairs and watching sparrows. He listens for blasphemy;
      looks for persons who laugh at priests; examines baptismal registers;
      watches professors in college who begin to doubt the geology of Moses and
      the astronomy of Joshua. He does not particularly object to stealing, if
      you won't swear. A great many persons have fallen dead in the act of
      taking God's name in vain, but millions of men, women and children have
      been stolen from their homes and used as beasts of burden, but no one
      engaged in this infamy has ever been touched by the wrathful hand of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then a man of genius, of sense, of intellectual honesty, has
      appeared. Such men have denounced the superstitions of their day. They
      have pitied the multitude. To see priests devour the substance of the
      people&mdash;priests who made begging one of the learned professions&mdash;filled
      them with loathing and contempt. These men were honest enough to tell
      their thoughts, brave enough to speak the truth. Then they were denounced,
      tried, tortured, killed by rack or flame. But some escaped the fury of the
      fiends who love their enemies, and died naturally in their beds. It would
      not do for the church to admit that they died peacefully. That would show
      that religion was not essential at the last moment. Superstition gets its
      power from the terror of death. It would not do to have the common people
      understand that a man could deny the Bible&mdash;refuse to kiss the cross&mdash;contend
      that Humanity was greater than Christ, and then die as sweetly as
      Torquemada did, after pouring molten lead into the ears of an honest man;
      or as calmly as Calvin after he had burned Servetus; or as peacefully as
      King David after advising with his last breath one son to assassinate
      another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church has taken great pains to show that the last moments of all
      infidels (that Christians did not succeed in burning) were infinitely
      wretched and despairing. It was alleged that words could not paint the
      horrors that were endured by a dying infidel. Every good Christian was
      expected to, and generally did, believe these accounts. They have been
      told and retold in every pulpit of the world. Protestant ministers have
      repeated the lies invented by Catholic priests, and Catholics, by a kind
      of theological comity, have sworn to the lies told by the Protestants.
      Upon this point they have always stood together, and will as long as the
      same falsehood can be used by both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of doing these things, Voltaire wilfully closed his eyes to the
      light of the gospel, examined the Bible for himself, advocated
      intellectual liberty, struck from the brain the fetters of an arrogant
      faith, assisted the weak, cried out against the torture of man, appealed
      to reason, endeavored to establish universal toleration, succored the
      indigent, and defended the oppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He demonstrated that the origin of all religions is the same&mdash;the
      same mysteries&mdash;the same miracles&mdash;the same imposture&mdash;the
      same temples and ceremonies&mdash;the same kind of founders, apostles and
      dupes&mdash;the same promises and threats&mdash;the same pretence of
      goodness and forgiveness and the practice of the same persecution and
      murder. He proved that religion made enemies&mdash;philosophy friends&mdash;and
      that above the rights of Gods were the rights of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were his crimes. Such a man God would not suffer to die in peace. If
      allowed to meet death with a smile, others might follow his example, until
      none would be left to light the holy fires of the <i>auto da fe</i>. It
      would not do for so great, so successful, an enemy of the church to die
      without leaving some shriek of fear, some shudder of remorse, some ghastly
      prayer of chattered horror uttered by lips covered with blood and foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many centuries the theologians have taught that an unbeliever&mdash;an
      infidel&mdash;one who spoke or wrote against their creed, could not meet
      death with composure; that in his last moments God would fill his
      conscience with the serpents of remorse.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a thousand years the clergy have manufactured the facts to fit this
      theory&mdash;this infamous conception of the duty of man and the justice
      of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theologians have insisted that crimes against man were, and are, as
      nothing compared with crimes against God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the death-bed subject the clergy grow eloquent. When describing the
      shudderings and shrieks of the dying unbeliever, their eyes glitter with
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are no longer men. They become hyenas. They dig open graves. They
      devour the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsatisfied still, they paint the terrors of hell. They gaze at the souls
      of the infidels writhing in the coils of the worm that never dies. They
      see them in flames&mdash;in oceans of fire&mdash;in gulfs of pain&mdash;in
      abysses of despair. They shout with joy. They applaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an <i>auto da fe</i>, presided over by God.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII. THE SECOND RETURN.
    </p>
    <p>
      FOR four hundred years the Bastile had been the outward symbol of
      oppression. Within its walls the noblest had perished. It was a perpetual
      threat. It was the last, and often the first, argument of king and priest.
      Its dungeons, damp and rayless, its massive towers, its secret cells, its
      instruments of torture, denied the existence of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1789, on the 14th of July, the people, the multitude, frenzied by
      suffering, stormed and captured the Bastile. The battle-cry was "Vive
      Voltaire."
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1791 permission was given to place in the Pantheon the ashes of
      Voltaire. He had been buried 110 miles from Paris. Buried by stealth, he
      was to be removed by a nation. A funeral procession of a hundred miles;
      every village with its flags and arches; all the people anxious to honor
      the philosopher of France&mdash;the Savior of Calas&mdash;the Destroyer of
      Superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      On reaching Paris the great procession moved along the Rue St. Antoine.
      Here it paused, and for one night upon the ruins of the Bastile rested the
      body of Voltaire&mdash;rested in triumph, in glory&mdash;rested on fallen
      wall and broken arch, on crumbling stone still damp with tears, on rusting
      chain and bar and useless bolt&mdash;above the dungeons dark and deep,
      where light had faded from the lives of men and hope had died in breaking
      hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conqueror resting upon the conquered.&mdash;Throned upon the Bastile,
      the fallen fortress of Night, the body of Voltaire, from whose brain had
      issued the Dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment his ashes must have felt the Promethean fire, and the old
      smile must have illumined once more the face of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The vast multitude bowed in reverence, hushed with love and awe heard
      these words uttered by a priest: "God shall be avenged."
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry of the priest was a prophecy. Priests skulking in the shadows with
      faces sinister as night, ghouls in the name of the gospel, desecrated the
      grave. They carried away the ashes of Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tomb is empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      God is avenged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The world is filled with his fame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man has conquered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was there in the eighteenth century, a man wearing the vestments of the
      church, the equal of Voltaire?
    </p>
    <p>
      What cardinal, what bishop, what priest in France raised his voice for the
      rights of men? What ecclesiastic, what nobleman, took the side of the
      oppressed&mdash;of the peasant? Who denounced the frightful criminal code&mdash;the
      torture of suspected persons? What priest pleaded for the liberty of the
      citizen? What bishop pitied the victims of the rack? Is there the grave of
      a priest in France on which a lover of liberty would now drop a flower or
      a tear? Is there a tomb holding the ashes of a saint from which emerges
      one ray of light?
    </p>
    <p>
      If there be another life&mdash;a day of judgment, no God can afford to
      torture in another world the man who abolished torture in this. If God be
      the keeper of an eternal penitentiary, he should not imprison there the
      men who broke the chains of slavery here. He cannot afford to make an
      eternal convict of Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire was a perfect master of the French language, knowing all its
      moods, tenses and declinations, in fact and in feeling&mdash;playing upon
      it as skillfully as Paganini on his violin, finding expression for every
      thought and fancy, writing on the most serious subjects with the gayety of
      a harlequin, plucking jests from the crumbling mouth of death, graceful as
      the waving of willows, dealing in double meanings that covered the asp
      with flowers and flattery&mdash;master of satire and compliment&mdash;mingling
      them often in the same line, always interested himself, and therefore
      interesting others&mdash;handling thoughts, questions, subjects as a
      juggler does balls, keeping them in the air with perfect ease&mdash;dressing
      old words in new meanings, charming, grotesque, pathetic, mingling mirth
      with tears, wit and wisdom, and sometimes wickedness, logic and laughter.
      With a woman's instinct knowing the sensitive nerves&mdash;just where to
      touch&mdash;hating arrogance of place, the stupidity of the solemn&mdash;snatching
      masks from priest and king, knowing the springs of action and ambition's
      ends&mdash;perfectly familiar with the great world&mdash;the intimate of
      kings and their favorites, sympathizing with the oppressed and imprisoned,
      with the unfortunate and poor, hating tyranny, despising superstition, and
      loving liberty with all his heart. Such was Voltaire writing "Odipus" at
      seventeen, "Irene" at eighty-three, and crowding between these two
      tragedies the accomplishment of a thousand lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      From his throne at the foot of the Alps, he pointed the finger of scorn at
      every hypocrite in Europe. For half a century, past rack and stake, past
      dungeon and cathedral, past altar and throne, he carried with brave hands
      the sacred torch of Reason, whose light at last will flood the world.

      I. LET US PUT WREATHS ON THE BROWS OF THE LIVING.
    </p>
    <p>
      IN the year 1855 the American people knew but little of books. Their
      ideals, their models, were English. Young and Pollok, Addison and Watts,
      were regarded as great poets. Some of the more reckless read Thomson's
      "Seasons" and the poems and novels of Sir Walter Scott. A few, not quite
      orthodox, delighted in the mechanical monotony of Pope, and the really
      wicked&mdash;those lost to all religious shame&mdash;were worshipers of
      Shakespeare. The really orthodox Protestant, untroubled by doubts,
      considered Milton the greatest poet of them all. Byron and Shelley were
      hardly respectable&mdash;not to be read by young persons. It was admitted
      on all hands that Burns was a child of nature of whom his mother was
      ashamed and proud.

      In the blessed year aforesaid, candor, free and sincere speech, were under
      the ban. Creeds at that time were entrenched behind statutes, prejudice,
      custom, ignorance, stupidity, Puritanism and slavery; that is to say,
      slavery of mind and body.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it always has been, and forever will be, impossible for slavery,
      or any kind or form of injustice, to produce a great poet. There are
      hundreds of verse makers and writers on the side of wrong&mdash;enemies of
      progress&mdash;but they are not poets, they are not men of genius.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this time a young man&mdash;he to whom this testimonial is given&mdash;he
      upon whose head have fallen the snows of more than seventy winters&mdash;this
      man, born within the sound of the sea, gave to the world a book, "Leaves
      of Grass." This book was, and is, the true transcript of a soul. The man
      is unmasked. No drapery of hypocrisy, no pretence, no fear. The book was
      as original in form as in thought. All customs were forgotten or
      disregarded, all rules broken&mdash;nothing mechanical&mdash;no imitation&mdash;spontaneous,
      running and winding like a river, multitudinous in its thoughts as the
      waves of the sea&mdash;nothing mathematical or measured&mdash;in
      everything a touch of chaos; lacking what is called form, as clouds lack
      form, but not lacking the splendor of sunrise or the glory of sunset. It
      was a marvelous collection and aggregation of fragments, hints,
      suggestions, memories, and prophecies, weeds and flowers, clouds and
      clods, sights and sounds, emotions and passions, waves, shadows and
      constellations.
    </p>
    <p>
      His book was received by many with disdain, with horror, with indignation
      and protest&mdash;by the few as a marvelous, almost miraculous, message to
      the world&mdash;full of thought, philosophy, poetry and music.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the republic of mediocrity genius is dangerous. A great soul appears
      and fills the world with new and marvelous harmonies. In his words is the
      old Promethean flame. The heart of nature beats and throbs in his line.
      The respectable prudes and pedagogues sound the alarm, and cry, or rather
      screech: "Is this a book for a young person?"
    </p>
    <p>
      A poem true to life as a Greek statue&mdash;candid as nature&mdash;fills
      these barren souls with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      They forget that drapery about the perfect was suggested by immodesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The provincial prudes, and others of like mold, pretend that love is a
      duty rather than a passion&mdash;a kind of self-denial&mdash;not an
      over-mastering joy. They preach the gospel of pretence and pantalettes, In
      the presence of sincerity, of truth, they cast down their eyes and
      endeavor to feel immodest. To them, the most beautiful thing is hypocrisy
      adorned with a blush.
    </p>
    <p>
      They have no idea of an honest, pure passion, glorying in its strength&mdash;intense,
      intoxicated with the beautiful, giving even to inanimate things pulse and
      motion, and that transfigures, ennobles, and idealizes the object of its
      adoration.
    </p>
    <p>
      They do not walk the streets of the city of life&mdash;they explore the
      sewers; they stand in the gutters and cry "Unclean!" They pretend that
      beauty is a snare; that love is a Delilah; that the highway of joy is the
      broad road, lined with flowers and filled with perfume, leading to the
      city of eternal sorrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the year 1855 the American people have developed; they are somewhat
      acquainted with the literature of the world. They have witnessed the most
      tremendous of revolutions, not only upon the fields of battle, but in the
      world of thought. The American citizen has concluded that it is hardly
      worth while being a sovereign unless he has the right to think for
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, from this height, with the vantage-ground of to-day, I propose to
      examine this book and to state, in a general way, what Walt Whitman has
      done, what he has accomplished, and the place he has won in the world of
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      II. THE RELIGION OF THE BODY.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALT WHITMAN stood when he published his book, where all stand to-night,
      on the perpetually moving line where history ends and prophecy begins. He
      was full of life to the very tips of his fingers&mdash;brave, eager,
      candid, joyous with health. He was acquainted with the past. He knew
      something of song and story, of philosophy and art; much of the heroic
      dead, of brave suffering, of the thoughts of men, the habits of the people&mdash;rich
      as well as poor&mdash;familiar with labor, a friend of wind and wave,
      touched by love and friendship, liking the open road, enjoying the fields
      and paths, the crags, friend of the forest&mdash;feeling that he was free&mdash;neither
      master nor slave; willing that all should know his thoughts; open as the
      sky, candid as nature, and he gave his thoughts, his dreams, his
      conclusions, his hopes and his mental portrait to his fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walt Whitman announced the gospel of the body. He confronted the people.
      He denied the depravity of man. He insisted that love is not a crime; that
      men and women should be proudly natural; that they need not grovel on the
      earth and cover their faces for shame, He taught the dignity and glory of
      the father and mother; the sacredness of maternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Maternity, tender and pure as the tear of pity, holy as suffering&mdash;the
      crown, the flower, the ecstasy of love!
    </p>
    <p>
      People had been taught from Bibles and from creeds that maternity was a
      kind of crime; that the woman should be purified by some ceremony in some
      temple built in honor of some god. This barbarism was attacked in "Leaves
      of Grass."
    </p>
    <p>
      The glory of simple life was sung; a declaration of independence was made
      for each and all.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet this appeal to manhood and to womanhood was misunderstood. It was
      denounced simply because it was in harmony with the great trend of nature.
      To me, the most obscene word in our language is celibacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not the fashion for people to speak or write their thoughts. We
      were flooded with the literature of hypocrisy. The writers did not
      faithfully describe the worlds in which they lived. They endeavored to
      make a fashionable world. They pretended that the cottage or the hut in
      which they dwelt was a palace, and they called the little area in which
      they threw their slops their domain, their realm, their empire. They were
      ashamed of the real, of what their world actually was. They imitated; that
      is to say, they told lies, and these lies filled the literature of most
      lands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walt Whitman defended the sacredness of love, the purity of passion&mdash;the
      passion that builds every home and fills the world with art and song.
    </p>
    <p>
      They cried out: "He is a defender of passion&mdash;he is a libertine! He
      lives in the mire. He lacks spirituality!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Whoever differs with the multitude, especially with a led multitude&mdash;that
      is to say, with a multitude of taggers&mdash;will find out from their
      leaders that he has committed an unpardonable sin. It is a crime to travel
      a road of your own, especially if you put up guide-boards for the
      information of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many, many centuries ago Epicurus, the greatest man of his century, and of
      many centuries before and after, said: "Happiness is the only good;
      happiness is the supreme end." This man was temperate, frugal, generous,
      noble&mdash;and yet through all these years he has been denounced by the
      hypocrites of the world as a mere eater and drinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was said that Whitman had exaggerated the importance of love&mdash;that
      he had made too much of this passion. Let me say that no poet&mdash;not
      excepting Shakespeare&mdash;has had imagination enough to exaggerate the
      importance of human love&mdash;a passion that contains all heights and all
      depths&mdash;ample as space, with a sky in which glitter all
      constellations, and that has within it all storms, all lightnings, all
      wrecks and ruins, all griefs, all sorrows, all shadows, and all the joy
      and sunshine of which the heart and brain are capable.
    </p>
    <p>
      No writer must be measured by a word or paragraph. He is to be measured by
      his work&mdash;by the tendency, not of one line, but by the tendency of
      all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Which way does the great stream tend? Is it for good or evil? Are the
      motives high and noble, or low and infamous?
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot measure Shakespeare by a few lines, neither can we measure the
      Bible by a few chapters, nor "Leaves of Grass" by a few paragraphs. In
      each there are many things that I neither approve nor believe&mdash;but in
      all books you will find a mingling of wisdom and foolishness, of
      prophecies and mistakes&mdash;in other words, among the excellencies there
      will be defects. The mine is not all gold, or all silver, or all diamonds&mdash;there
      are baser metals. The trees of the forest are not all of one size. On some
      of the highest there are dead and useless limbs, and there may be growing
      beneath the bushes weeds, and now and then a poisonous vine.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I were to edit the great books of the world, I might leave out some
      lines and I might leave out the best. I have no right to make of my brain
      a sieve and say that only that which passes through belongs to the rest of
      the human race. I claim the right to choose. I give that right to all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walt Whitman had the courage to express his thought&mdash;the candor to
      tell the truth. And here let me say it gives me joy&mdash;a kind of
      perfect satisfaction&mdash;to look above the bigoted bats, the satisfied
      owls and wrens and chickadees, and see the great eagle poised, circling
      higher and higher, unconscious of their existence. And it gives me joy, a
      kind of perfect satisfaction, to look above the petty passions and
      jealousies of small and respectable people, above the considerations of
      place and power and reputation, and see a brave, intrepid man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be remembered that the American people had separated from the Old
      World&mdash;that we had declared not only the independence of colonies,
      but the independence of the individual. We had done more&mdash;we had
      declared that the state could no longer be ruled by the church, and that
      the church could not be ruled by the state, and that the individual could
      not be ruled by the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      These declarations were in danger of being forgotten. We needed a new
      voice, sonorous, loud and clear, a new poet for America, for the new
      epoch, somebody to chant the morning song of the new day.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great man who gives a true transcript of his mind, fascinates and
      instructs. Most writers suppress individuality. They wish to please the
      public. They flatter the stupid and pander to the prejudice of their
      readers. They write for the market, making books as other mechanics make
      shoes. They have no message, they bear no torch, they are simply the
      slaves of customers.
    </p>
    <p>
      The books they manufacture are handled by "the trade;" they are regarded
      as harmless. The pulpit does not object; the young person can read the
      monotonous pages without a blush&mdash;or a thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the title pages of these books you will find the imprint of the great
      publishers; on the rest of the pages, nothing. These books might be
      prescribed for insomnia.
    </p>
    <p>
      III.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men of talent, men of business, touch life upon few sides. They travel but
      the beaten path. The creative spirit is not in them. They regard with
      suspicion a poet who touches life on every side. They have little
      confidence in that divine thing called sympathy, and they do not and
      cannot understand the man who enters into the hopes, the aims and the
      feelings of all others.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all genius there is the touch of chaos&mdash;a little of the vagabond;
      and the successful tradesman, the man who buys and sells, or manages a
      bank, does not care to deal with a person who has only poems for
      collaterals; they have a little fear of such people, and regard them as
      the awkward countryman does a sleight-of-hand performer.
    </p>
    <p>
      In every age in which books have been produced the governing class, the
      respectable, have been opposed to the works of real genius. If what are
      known as the best people could have had their way, if the pulpit had been
      consulted&mdash;the provincial moralists&mdash;the works of Shakespeare
      would have been suppressed. Not a line would have reached our time. And
      the same may be said of every dramatist of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the Scotch Kirk could have decided, nothing would have been known of
      Robert Burns. If the good people, the orthodox, could have had their say,
      not one line of Voltaire would now be known. All the plates of the French
      Encyclopedia would have been destroyed with the thousands that were
      destroyed. Nothing would have been known of D'Alembert, Grimm, Diderot, or
      any of the Titans who warred against the thrones and altars and laid the
      foundation of modern literature not only, but what is of far greater
      moment, universal education.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not too much to say that every book now held in high esteem would
      have been destroyed, if those in authority could have had their will.
      Every book of modern times that has a real value, that has enlarged the
      intellectual horizon of mankind, that has developed the brain, that has
      furnished real food for thought, can be found in the Index Expurgatorius
      of the Papacy, and nearly every one has been commended to the free minds
      of men by the denunciations of Protestants.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the guardians of society, the protectors of "young persons," could have
      had their way, we should have known nothing of Byron or Shelley. The
      voices that thrill the world would now be silent. If authority could have
      had its way, the world would have been as ignorant now as it was when our
      ancestors lived in holes or hung from dead limbs by their prehensile
      tails.
    </p>
    <p>
      But we are not forced to go very far back. If Shakespeare had been
      published for the first time now, those divine plays&mdash;greater than
      continents and seas, greater even than the constellations of the midnight
      sky&mdash;would be excluded from the mails by the decision of the present
      enlightened postmaster-general.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poets have always lived in an ideal world, and that ideal world has
      always been far better than the real world. As a consequence, they have
      forever roused, not simply the imagination, but the energies&mdash;the
      enthusiasm of the human race.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great poets have been on the side of the oppressed&mdash;of the
      downtrodden. They have suffered with the imprisoned and the enslaved, and
      whenever and wherever man has suffered for the right, wherever the hero
      has been stricken down&mdash;whether on field or scaffold&mdash;some man
      of genius has walked by his side, and some poet has given form and
      expression, not simply to his deeds, but to his aspirations.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Greek and Roman world we still hear the voices of a few. The
      poets, the philosophers, the artists and the orators still speak.
      Countless millions have been covered by the waves of oblivion, but the few
      who uttered the elemental truths, who had sympathy for the whole human
      race, and who were great enough to prophesy a grander day, are as alive
      to-night as when they roused, by their bodily presence, by their living
      voices, by their works of art, the enthusiasm of their fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Think of the respectable people, of the men of wealth and position, those
      who dwelt in mansions, children of success, who went down to the grave
      voiceless, and whose names we do not know. Think of the vast multitudes,
      the endless processions, that entered the caverns of eternal night,
      leaving no thought, no truth as a legacy to mankind!
    </p>
    <p>
      The great poets have sympathized with the people. They have uttered in all
      ages the human cry. Unbought by gold, unawed by power, they have lifted
      high the torch that illuminates the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walt Whitman is in the highest sense a believer in democracy. He knows
      that there is but one excuse for government&mdash;the preservation of
      liberty, to the end that man may be happy. He knows that there is but one
      excuse for any institution, secular or religious&mdash;the preservation of
      liberty; and that there is but one excuse for schools, lor universal
      education, for the ascertainment of facts, namely, the preservation of
      liberty. He resents the arrogance and cruelty of power. He has sworn never
      to be tyrant or slave. He has solemnly declared:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy, By God!
      I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the
      same terms</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      This one declaration covers the entire ground. It is a declaration of
      independence, and it is also a declaration of justice, that is to say, a
      declaration of the independence of the individual, and a declaration that
      all shall be free. The man who has this spirit can truthfully say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>I have taken off my hat to nothing known or unknown. I am for those
      that have never been master'd.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in Whitman what he calls "The boundless impatience of restraint,"
      together with that sense of justice which compelled him to say, "Neither a
      servant nor a master am I."
    </p>
    <p>
      He was wise enough to know that giving others the same rights that he
      claims for himself could not harm him, and he was great enough to say: "As
      if it were not indispensable to my own rights that others possess the
      same."
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt as all should feel, that the liberty of no man is safe unless the
      liberty of each is safe.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is in our country a little of the old servile spirit, a little of
      the bowing and cringing to others. Many Americans do not understand that
      the officers of the government are simply the servants of the people.
      Nothing is so demoralizing as the worship of place. Whitman has reminded
      the people of this country that they are supreme, and he has said to them:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>The President is there in the White House for you, it is not you who
      are here for him, The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you, not you
      here for them. Doctrines, politics and civilization exurge from you,
      Sculpture and monuments and any thing inscribed anywhere are tallied in
      you</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      He describes the ideal American citizen&mdash;the one who
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Says indifferently and alike 'How are you, friend?' to the President
      at his levee, And he says 'Good-day, my brother,' to Cudge that hoes in
      the sugar-field</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      Long ago, when the politicians were wrong, when the judges were
      subservient, when the pulpit was a coward, Walt Whitman shouted:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>Man shall not hold property in man.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>The least develop'd person on earth is just as important and sacred to
      himself or herself as the most develop'd person is to himself or herself.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the very soul of true democracy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beauty is not all there is of poetry. It must contain the truth. It is not
      simply an oak, rude and grand, neither is it simply a vine. It is both.
      Around the oak of truth runs the vine of beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walt Whitman utters the elemental truths and is the poet of democracy. He
      is also the poet of individuality.
    </p>
    <p>
      V. INDIVIDUALITY.
    </p>
    <p>
      IN order to protect the liberties of a nation, we must protect the
      individual. A democracy is a nation of free individuals. The individuals
      are not to be sacrificed to the nation. The nation exists only for the
      purpose of guarding and protecting the individuality of men and women.
      Walt Whitman has told us that: "The whole theory of the universe is
      directed unerringly to one single individual&mdash;namely to You."
    </p>
    <p>
      And he has also told us that the greatest city&mdash;the greatest nation&mdash;is
      "where the citizen is always the head and ideal."
    </p>
    <p>
      And that
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>A great city is that which has the greatest men and women, If it be a
      few ragged huts it is still the greatest city in the whole world.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      By this test maybe the greatest city on the continent to-night is Camden.
    </p>
    <p>
      This poet has asked of us this question:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>What do you suppose will satisfy the soul, except to walk free and own
      no superior?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who asks this question has left no impress of his lips in the
      dust, and has no dirt upon his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was great enough to say:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson
      but its own.</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      He carries the idea of individuality to its utmost height:
    </p>
    <p>
      "<i>What do you suppose I would intimate to you in a hundred ways, but
      that man or woman is as good as God? And that there is no God any more
      divine than Yourself?</i>"
    </p>
    <p>
      Glorying in individuality, in the freedom of the soul, he cries out:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!
  To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!
  To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!
  To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect nonchalance!
  To be indeed a God!"
</pre>
    <p>
      And again:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "O the joy of a manly self-hood!
  To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant known or unknown,

  To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,
  To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,

  To speak with full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,
  To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the earth."
</pre>
    <p>
      Walt Whitman is willing to stand alone. He is sufficient unto himself, and
      he says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune.
  Strong and content I travel the open road."

<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and Governors,
  as to say 'Who are you? '"
</pre>
    <p>
      And not only this, but he has the courage to say: "Nothing, not God, is
      greater to one than one's self." Walt Whitman is the poet of Individuality&mdash;the
      defender of the rights of each for the sake of all&mdash;and his
      sympathies are as wide as the world. He is the defender of the whole race.

      VI. HUMANITY.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE great poet is intensely human, infinitely sympathetic, entering into
      the joys and griefs of others, bearing their burdens, knowing their
      sorrows. Brain without heart is not much; they must act together. When the
      respectable people of the North, the rich, the successful, were willing to
      carry out the Fugitive Slave Law, Walt Whitman said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,
  Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,
  I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn'd with the ooze of my skin,
  I fall on the weeds and stones,
  The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,
  Taunt my dizzy ears, and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.
  Agonies are one of my changes of garments,
  I do not ask the wounded person how he feels,
  I myself become the wounded person....
  I... see myself in prison shaped like another man,
  And feel the dull unintermitted pain.
  For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,
  It is I let out in the morning and barr'd at night.
  Not a mutineer walks handcuff'd to jail but I am handcuff'd to him and walk by his side.
  Judge not as the judge judges, but as the sun falling upon a helpless thing."
</pre>
    <p>
      Of the very worst he had the infinite tenderness to say: "Not until the
      sun excludes you will I exclude you."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this age of greed when houses and lands and stocks and bonds outrank
      human life; when gold is of more value than blood, these words should be
      read by all:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "When the psalm sings instead of the singer,
  When the script preaches instead of the preacher,
  When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that carved the supporting desk,
  When I can touch the body of books by night or day, and when they touch my body back again,"
  When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman and child convince,
  When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night-watchman's daughter,
  When warrantee deeds loaf in chairs opposite and are my friendly companions,
  I intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of them as I do of men and women like you."
</pre>

    </p>
    <p>
      The poet is also a painter, a sculptor&mdash;he, too, deals in form and
      color. The great poet is of necessity a great artist. With a few words he
      creates pictures, filling his canvas with living men and women&mdash;with
      those who feel and speak. Have you ever read the account of the
      stage-driver's funeral? Let me read it:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Cold dash of waves at the ferry-wharf, posh and ice in the river, half-frozen mud in the streets,
  A gray discouraged sky overhead, the short, last daylight of December,
  A hearse and stages, the funeral of an old Broadway stage-driver, the cortege mostly drivers.
  Steady the trot to the cemetery, duly rattles the death-bell, The gate is pass'd, the new-dug grave is halted at, the living alight, the hearse uncloses.
  The coffin is pass'd out, lower'd and settled, the whip is laid on the coffin, the earth is swiftly shovel'd in,
  The mound above is flatted with the spades&mdash;silence,
  A minute&mdash;no one moves or speaks&mdash;it is done,
  He is decently put away&mdash;is there anything more?
  He was a good fellow, free-mouth'd, quick-temper'd, not bad-looking,
  Ready with life or death for a friend, fond of women, gambled, ate hearty, drank hearty,
  Had known what it was to be flush, grew low-spirited toward the last, sicken'd, was helped by a contribution, Died, aged forty-one years&mdash;and that was his funeral."
</pre>
    <p>
      Let me read you another description, one of a woman:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Behold a woman!
  She looks out from her quaker cap, her face is clearer and more beautiful than the sky.
  She sits in an armchair under the shaded porch of the farmhouse,
  The sun just shines on her old white head.
  Her ample gown is of cream-hued linen,
  Her grandsons raised the flax, and her granddaughters spun it with the distaff and the wheel.
  The melodious character of the earth.
  The finish beyond which philosophy cannot go and does not wish to go,
  The justified mother of men."
</pre>
    <p>
      Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
    </p>
    <p>
      "Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars? List to the
      yarn, as my grandmother's father the sailor told it to me. Our foe was no
      skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,) His was the surly English pluck,
      and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be; Along
      the lower'd eve he came horribly raking us. We closed with him, the yards
      entangled, the cannon touch'd, My captain lash'd fast with his own hands.
      We had receiv'd some eighteen pound shots under the water, On our lower
      gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around
      and blowing up overhead. Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark, Ten
      o'clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five
      feet of water reported, The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined
      in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves. The transit to and
      from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels, They see so many strange
      faces they do not know whom to trust.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  Our frigate takes fire,
  The other asks if we demand quarter?
  If our colors are struck and the fighting done?
  Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,
  'We have not struck,' he composedly cries, 'we have just begun our part of the fighting.'
  Only three guns are in use,
  One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy's mainmast,
  Two well serv'd with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.
  The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,
  They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.
  Not a moment's cease,
  The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazines.
  One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.
  Serene stands the little captain,
  He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,
  His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.
  Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon the surrender to us.
  Stretch'd and still lies the midnight,
  Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness. Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer'd,
  The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet,
  Near by the corpse of the child that serv'd in the cabin, The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl'd whiskers,
  The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,
  The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty, Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,
  Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,
  Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,
  A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining, Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,
  The hiss of the surgeon's knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,
  Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan."
</pre>
    <p>
      Some people say that this is not poetry&mdash;that it lacks measure and
      rhyme.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII. WHAT IS POETRY?
    </p>
    <p>
      THE whole world is engaged in the invisible commerce of thought. That is
      to say, in the exchange of thoughts by words, symbols, sounds, colors and
      forms. The motions of the silent, invisible world, where feeling glows and
      thought flames&mdash;that contains all seeds of action&mdash;are made
      known only by sounds and colors, forms, objects, relations, uses and
      qualities, so that the visible universe is a dictionary, an aggregation of
      symbols, by which and through which is carried on the invisible commerce
      of thought. Each object is capable of many meanings, or of being used in
      many ways to convey ideas or states of feeling or of facts that take place
      in the world of the brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest poet is the one who selects the best, the most appropriate
      symbols to convey the best, the highest, the sublimest thoughts. Each man
      occupies a world of his own. He is the only citizen of his world. He is
      subject and sovereign, and the best he can do is to give the facts
      concerning the world in which he lives to the citizens of other worlds. No
      two of these worlds are alike. They are of all kinds, from the flat,
      barren, and uninteresting&mdash;from the small and shriveled and worthless&mdash;to
      those whose rivers and mountains and seas and constellations belittle and
      cheapen the visible world. The inhabitants of these marvelous worlds have
      been the singers of songs, utterers of great speech&mdash;the creators of
      art.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here lies the difference between creators and imitators: the creator
      tells what passes in his own world&mdash;the imitator does not. The
      imitator abdicates, and by the fact of imitation falls upon his knees. He
      is like one who, hearing a traveler talk, pretends to others that he has
      traveled.
    </p>
    <p>
      In nearly all lands, the poet has been privileged. For the sake of beauty,
      they have allowed him to speak, and for that reason he has told the story
      of the oppressed, and has excited the indignation of honest men and even
      the pity of tyrants. He, above all others, has added to the intellectual
      beauty of the world. He has been the true creator of language, and has
      left his impress on mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      What I have said is not only true of poetry&mdash;it is true of all
      speech. All are compelled to use the visible world as a dictionary. Words
      have been invented and are being invented, for the reason that new powers
      are found in the old symbols, new qualities, relations, uses and meanings.
      The growth of language is necessary on account of the development of the
      human mind. The savage needs but few symbols&mdash;the civilized many&mdash;the
      poet most of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old idea was, however, that the poet must be a rhymer. Before printing
      was known, it was said: the rhyme assists the memory. That excuse no
      longer exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is rhyme a necessary part of poetry? In my judgment, rhyme is a hindrance
      to expression. The rhymer is compelled to wander from his subject, to say
      more or less than he means, to introduce irrelevant matter that interferes
      continually with the dramatic action and is a perpetual obstruction to
      sincere utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      All poems, of necessity, must be short. The highly and purely poetic is
      the sudden bursting into blossom of a great and tender thought. The
      planting of the seed, the growth, the bud and flower must be rapid. The
      spring must be quick and warm, the soil perfect, the sunshine and rain
      enough&mdash;everything should tend to hasten, nothing to delay. In
      poetry, as in wit, the crystallization must be sudden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest poems are rhythmical. While rhyme is a hindrance, rhythm
      seems to be the comrade of the poetic. Rhythm has a natural foundation.
      Under emotion the blood rises and falls, the muscles contract and relax,
      and this action of the blood is as rhythmical as the rise and fall of the
      sea. In the highest form of expression the thought should be in harmony
      with this natural ebb and flow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest poetic truth is expressed in rhythmical form. I have sometimes
      thought that an idea selects its own words, chooses its own garments, and
      that when the thought has possession, absolutely, of the speaker or
      writer, he unconsciously allows the thought to clothe itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great poetry of the world keeps time with the winds and the waves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not mean by rhythm a recurring accent at accurately measured
      intervals. Perfect time is the death of music. There should always be room
      for eager haste and delicious delay, and whatever change there may be in
      the rhythm or time, the action itself should suggest perfect freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      A word more about rhythm. I believe that certain feelings and passions&mdash;-joy,
      grief, emulation, revenge, produce certain molecular movements in the
      brain&mdash;that every thought is accompanied by certain physical
      phenomena. Now, it may be that certain sounds, colors, and forms produce
      the same molecular action in the brain that accompanies certain feelings,
      and that these sounds, colors and forms produce first the molecular
      movements and these in their turn reproduce the feelings, emotions and
      states of mind capable of producing the same or like molecular movements.
      So that what we call heroic music produces the same molecular action in
      the brain&mdash;the same physical changes&mdash;that are produced by the
      real feeling of heroism; that the sounds we call plaintive produce the
      same molecular movement in the brain that grief, or the twilight of grief,
      actually produces. There may be a rhythmical molecular movement belonging
      to each state of mind, that accompanies each thought or passion, and it
      may be that music, or painting, or sculpture, produces the same state of
      mind or feeling that produces the music or painting or sculpture, by
      producing the same molecular movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      All arts are born of the same spirit, and express like thoughts in
      different ways&mdash;that is to say, they produce like states of mind and
      feeling. The sculptor, the painter, the composer, the poet, the orator,
      work to the same end, with different materials. The painter expresses
      through form and color and relation; the sculptor through form and
      relation. The poet also paints and chisels&mdash;his words give form,
      relation and color. His statues and his paintings do not crumble, neither
      do they fade, nor will they as long as language endures. The composer
      touches the passions, produces the very states of feeling produced by the
      painter and sculptor, the poet and orator. In all these there must be
      rhythm&mdash;that is to say, proportion&mdash;that is to say, harmony,
      melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      So that the greatest poet is the one who idealizes the common, who gives
      new meanings to old symbols, who transfigures the ordinary things of life.
      He must deal with the hopes and fears, and with the experiences of the
      people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The poetic is not the exceptional. A perfect poem is like a perfect day.
      It has the undefinable charm of naturalness and ease. It must not appear
      to be the result of great labor. We feel, in spite of ourselves, that man
      does best that which he does easiest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great poet is the instrumentality, not always of his time, but of the
      best of his time, and he must be in unison and accord with the ideals of
      his race. The sublimer he is, the simpler he is. The thoughts of the
      people must be clad in the garments of feeling&mdash;the words must be
      known, apt, familiar. The height must be in the thought, in the sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the olden time they used to have May day parties, and the prettiest
      child was crowned Queen of May. Imagine an old blacksmith and his wife
      looking at their little daughter clad in white and crowned with roses.
      They would wonder while they looked at her, how they ever came to have so
      beautiful a child. It is thus that the poet clothes the intellectual
      children or ideals of the people. They must not be gemmed and garlanded
      beyond the recognition of their parents. Out from all the flowers and
      beauty must look the eyes of the child they know.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have grown tired of gods and goddesses in art. Milton's heavenly
      militia excites our laughter. Light-houses have driven sirens from the
      dangerous coasts. We have found that we do not depend on the imagination
      for wonders&mdash;there are millions of miracles under our feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be more marvelous than the common and everyday facts of life.
      The phantoms have been cast aside. Men and women are enough for men and
      women. In their lives is all the tragedy and all the comedy that they can
      comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      The painter no longer crowds his canvas with the winged and impossible&mdash;he
      paints life as he sees it, people as he knows them, and in whom he is
      interested. "The Angelus," the perfection of pathos, is nothing but two
      peasants bending their heads in thankfulness as they hear the solemn sound
      of the distant bell&mdash;two peasants, who have nothing to be thankful
      for, nothing but weariness and want, nothing but the crusts that they
      soften with their tears&mdash;nothing. And yet as you look at that picture
      you feel that they have something besides to be thankful for&mdash;that
      they have life, love, and hope&mdash;and so the distant bell makes music
      in their simple hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attitude of Whitman toward religion has not been understood. Toward
      all forms of worship, toward all creeds, he has maintained the attitude of
      absolute fairness. He does not believe that Nature has given her last
      message to man. He does not believe that all has been ascertained. He
      denies that any sect has written down the entire truth. He believes in
      progress, and so believing he says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "We consider Bibles and religions divine&mdash;I do not say they are not divine,
  I say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you still,
  It is not they who give the life, it is you who give the life."

  "His [the poet's] thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,
  In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent."

  "Have you thought there could be but a single supreme?
  There can be any number of supremes&mdash;one does not countervail another
  anymore than one eyesight countervails another."
</pre>
    <p>
      Upon the great questions, as to the great problems, he feels only the
      serenity of a great and well-poised soul:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.
  I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,
  Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself....
  In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,
  I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign'd by God's name."
</pre>
    <p>
      The whole visible world is regarded by him as a revelation, and so is the
      invisible world, and with this feeling he writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Not objecting to special revelations&mdash;considering a curl of smoke or
      a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation."
    </p>
    <p>
      The creeds do not satisfy, the old mythologies are not enough; they are
      too narrow at best, giving only hints and suggestions; and feeling this
      lack in that which has been written and preached, Whitman says:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Magnifying and applying come I,
  Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,
  Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah, Lithographing Kronos,
  Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,
  Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,
  In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved,
  With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli, and every idol and image,
  Taking them all for what they are worth, and not a cent more."
</pre>
    <p>
      Whitman keeps open house. He is intellectually hospitable. He extends his
      hand to a new idea. He does not accept a creed because it is wrinkled and
      old and has a long white beard. He knows that hypocrisy has a venerable
      look, and that it relies on looks and masks, on stupidity and fear.
      Neither does he reject or accept the new because it is new. He wants the
      truth, and so he welcomes all until he knows just who and what they are.
    </p>
    <p>
      X. PHILOSOPHY.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALT WHITMAN is a philosopher. The more a man has thought, the more he has
      studied, the more he has traveled intellectually, the less certain he is.
      Only the very ignorant are perfectly satisfied that they know. To the
      common man the great problems are easy. He has no trouble in accounting
      for the universe. He can tell you the origin and destiny of man and the
      why and the wherefore of things. As a rule, he is a believer in special
      providence, and is egotistic enough to suppose that everything that
      happens in the universe happens in reference to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A colony of red ants lived at the foot of the Alps. It happened one day
      that an avalanche destroyed the hill; and one of the ants was heard to
      remark: "Who could have taken so much trouble to destroy our home?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Walt Whitman walked by the side of the sea "where the fierce old mother
      endlessly cries for her castaways," and endeavored to think out, to fathom
      the mystery of being; and he said:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "I too but signify at the utmost a little wash'd-up drift,
  A few sands and dead leaves to gather,
  Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.
  Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me
  I have not once had the least idea who or what I am,
  But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet untouch'd,
  untold, altogether unreach'd,
  Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows,
  With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written,
  Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath....
  I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single object,
  and that no man ever can."
</pre>
    <p>
      There is in our language no profounder poem than the one entitled
      "Elemental Drifts."
    </p>
    <p>
      The effort to find the origin has ever been, and will forever be,
      fruitless. Those who endeavor to find the secret of life resemble a man
      looking in the mirror, who thinks that if he only could be quick enough he
      could grasp the image that he sees behind the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latest word of this poet upon this subject is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "To me this life with all its realities and functions is finally a
      mystery, the real something yet to be evolved, and the stamp and shape and
      life here somehow giving an important, perhaps the main outline to
      something further. Somehow this hangs over everything else, and stands
      behind it, is inside of all facts, and the concrete and material, and the
      worldly affairs of life and sense. That is the purport and meaning behind
      all the other meanings of Leaves of Grass."
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact, the questions of origin and destiny are beyond the
      grasp of the human mind. We can see a certain distance; beyond that,
      everything is indistinct; and beyond the indistinct is the unseen. In the
      presence of these mysteries&mdash;and everything is a mystery so far as
      origin, destiny, and nature are concerned&mdash;the intelligent, honest
      man is compelled to say, "I do not know."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the great midnight a few truths like stars shine on forever, and from
      the brain of man come a few struggling gleams of light, a few momentary
      sparks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some have contended that everything is spirit; others that everything is
      matter; and again, others have maintained that a part is matter and a part
      is spirit; some that spirit was first and matter after; others that matter
      was first and spirit after; and others that matter and spirit have existed
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      But none of these people can by any possibility tell what matter is, or
      what spirit is, or what the difference is between spirit and matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The materialists look upon the spiritualists as substantially crazy; and
      the spiritualists regard the materialists as low and groveling. These
      spiritualistic people hold matter in contempt; but, after all, matter is
      quite a mystery. Y ou take in your hand a little earth&mdash;a little
      dust. Do you know what it is? In this dust you put a seed; the rain falls
      upon it; the light strikes it; the seed grows; it bursts into blossom; it
      produces fruit.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is this dust&mdash;this womb? Do you understand it? Is there anything
      in the wide universe more wonderful than this?
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a grain of sand, reduce it to powder, take the smallest possible
      particle, look at it with a microscope, contemplate its every part for
      days, and it remains the citadel of a secret&mdash;an impregnable
      fortress. Bring all the theologians, philosophers, and scientists in
      serried ranks against it; let them attack on every side with all the arts
      and arms of thought and force. The citadel does not fall. Over the
      battlements floats the flag, and the victorious secret smiles at the
      baffled hosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walt Whitman did not and does not imagine that he has reached the limit&mdash;the
      end of the road traveled by the human race. He knows that every victory
      over nature is but the preparation for another battle. This truth was in
      his mind when he said: "Understand me well; it is provided in the essence
      of things, that from any fruition of success, no matter what, shall come
      forth something to make a greater struggle necessary."
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the generalization of all history.
    </p>

      XI. THE TWO POEMS.
    </p>
    <p>
      THERE are two of these poems to which I will call special attention. The
      first is entitled, "A Word Out of the Sea."
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy, coming out of the rocked cradle, wandering over the sands and
      fields, up from the mystic play of shadows, out of the patches of briers
      and blackberries&mdash;from the memories of birds&mdash;from the thousand
      responses of his heart&mdash;goes back to the sea and his childhood, and
      sings a reminiscence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two guests from Alabama&mdash;two birds&mdash;build their nest, and there
      were four light green eggs, spotted with brown, and the two birds sang for
      joy:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Shine! shine! shine!
  Pour down your warmth, great sun!
  While we bask, we two together.
  Two together!
  Winds blow south, or winds blow north,
  Day come white, or night come black, .
  Home, or rivers and mountains from home,
  Singing all time, minding no time,
  While we two keep together."
</pre>
    <p>
      In a little while one of the birds is missed and never appeared again, and
      all through the summer the mate, the solitary guest, was singing of the
      lost:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Blow! blow! blow!
  Blow up sea-winds along Paumanok's shore;
  I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me."
</pre>
    <p>
      And the boy that night, blending himself with the shadows, with bare feet,
      went down to the sea, where the white arms out in the breakers were
      tirelessly tossing; listening to the songs and translating the notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And the singing bird called loud and high for the mate, wondering what the
      dusky spot was in the brown and yellow, seeing the mate whichever way he
      looked, piercing the woods and the earth with his song, hoping that the
      mate might hear his cry; stopping that he might not lose her answer;
      waiting and then crying again: "Here I am! And this gentle call is for
      you. Do not be deceived by the whistle of the wind; those are the
      shadows;" and at last crying:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "O past! O happy life! O songs of joy!
  In the air, in the woods, over fields,
  Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!
  But my mate no more, no more with me!
  We two together no more."
</pre>
    <p>
      And then the 'boy, understanding the song that had awakened in his breast
      a thousand songs clearer and louder and more sorrowful than the birds,
      knowing that the cry of unsatisfied love would never again be absent from
      him; thinking then of the destiny of all, and asking of the sea the final
      word, and the sea answering, delaying not and hurrying not, spoke the low
      delicious word "Death!" "ever Death!"
    </p>
    <p>
      The next poem, one that will live as long as our language, entitled: "When
      Lilacs Last in the Door-yard Bloom'd," is on the death of Lincoln,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "The sweetest, wisest soul of all my days and lands."
</pre>
    <p>
      One who reads this will never forget the odor of the lilac, "the lustrous
      western star" and "the gray-brown bird singing in the pines and cedars."
    </p>
    <p>
      In this poem the dramatic unities are perfectly preserved, the atmosphere
      and climate in harmony with every event.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never will he forget the solemn journey of the coffin through day and
      night, with the great cloud darkening the land, nor the pomp of inlooped
      flags, the processions long and winding, the flambeaus of night, the
      torches' flames, the silent sea of faces, the unbared heads, the thousand
      voices rising strong and solemn, the dirges, the shuddering organs, the
      tolling bells&mdash;and the sprig of lilac.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then for a moment they will hear the gray-brown bird singing in the
      cedars, bashful and tender, while the lustrous star lingers in the west,
      and they will remember the pictures hung on the chamber walls to adorn the
      burial house&mdash;pictures of spring and farms and homes, and the gray
      smoke lucid and bright, and the floods of yellow gold&mdash;of the
      gorgeous indolent sinking sun&mdash;the sweet herbage under foot&mdash;the
      green leaves of the trees prolific&mdash;the breast of the river with the
      wind-dapple here and there, and the varied and ample land&mdash;and the
      most excellent sun so calm and haughty&mdash;the violet and purple morn
      with just-felt breezes&mdash;the gentle soft-born measureless light&mdash;the
      miracle spreading, bathing all&mdash;the fulfill'd noon&mdash;the coming
      eve delicious, and the welcome night and the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then again they will hear the song of the gray-brown bird in the
      limitless dusk amid the cedars and pines. Again they will remember the
      star, and again the odor of the lilac.
    </p>
    <p>
      But most of all, the song of the bird translated and becoming the chant
      for death:
    </p>
    <p>
      A CHANT FOR DEATH.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "Come lovely and soothing death,
  Undulate round the world, serenely arriving, arriving,
  In the day, in the night, to all, to each,
  Sooner or later delicate death.
  Prais'd be the fathomless universe,
  For life and joy, and for objects and knowledge curious,
  And for love, sweet love&mdash;but praise! praise! praise!
  For the sure-enwinding arms of cool-enfolding death.
  Dark mother always gliding near with soft feet,
  Have none chanted for thee a chant of fullest welcome?
  Then I chant it for thee, I glorify thee above all,
  I bring thee a song that when thou must indeed come, come unfalteringly.
  Approach strong deliveress,
  When it is so, when thou hast taken them I joyously sing the dead,
  Lost in the loving floating ocean of thee,
  Laved in the flood of thy bliss, O death.
  From me to thee glad serenades,
  Dances for thee I propose saluting thee, adornments and 'feastings for thee,
  And the sights of the open landscape and the high spread sky are fitting,
  And life and the fields, and the huge and thoughtful night.
  The night in silence under many a star,
  The ocean shore and the husky whispering wave whose voice I know,
  And the soul turning to thee O vast and well-veil'd death,
  And the body gratefully nestling close to thee.
  Over the tree-tops I float thee a song,
  Over the rising and sinking waves, over the myriad fields and the prairies wide,
  Over the dense-pack'd cities all and the teeming wharves and ways,
  I float this carol with joy, with joy to thee O death."
</pre>
    <p>
      This poem, in memory of "the sweetest, wisest soul of all our days and
      lands," and for whose sake lilac and star and bird entwined, will last as
      long as the memory of Lincoln.
    </p>
    <p>
      XII. OLD AGE.
    </p>
    <p>
      WALT WHITMAN is not only the poet of childhood, of youth, of manhood, but,
      above all, of old age. He has not been soured by slander or petrified by
      prejudice; neither calumny nor flattery has made him revengeful or
      arrogant. Now sitting by the fireside, in the winter of life,
    </p>
    <p>
      "His jocund heart still beating in his breast," he is just as brave and
      calm and kind as in his manhood's proudest days, when roses blossomed in
      his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He has taken life's seven steps. Now, as the gamester might say, "on
      velvet," he is enjoying "old age, expanded, broad, with the haughty
      breadth of the universe; old age, flowing free, with the delicious near-by
      freedom of death; old age, superbly rising, welcoming the ineffable
      aggregation of dying days."
    </p>
    <p>
      He is taking the "loftiest look at last," and before he goes he utters
      thanks:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "For health, the midday sun, the impalpable air&mdash;for life, mere life,
  For precious ever-lingering memories,
  (of you my mother dear&mdash;you, father&mdash;you, brothers, sisters, friends,)
  For all my days&mdash;not those of peace alone&mdash;the days of war the same,
  For gentle words, caresses, gifts from foreign lands,
  For shelter, wine and meat&mdash;for sweet appreciation,
  (You distant, dim unknown&mdash;or young or old&mdash;countless, unspecified,
  readers belov'd,
  We never met, and ne'er shall meet&mdash;and yet our souls embrace,
  long, close and long;)
  For beings, groups, love, deeds, words, books&mdash;for colors, forms,
  For all the brave strong men&mdash;devoted, hardy men&mdash;who've forward
  sprung in freedom's help, all years, all lands,
  For braver, stronger, more devoted men&mdash;(a special laurel ere I go,
  to life's war's chosen ones,
  The cannoneers of song and thought&mdash;the great artillerists&mdash;
  the foremost leaders, captains of the soul:"
</pre>
    <p>
      It is a great thing to preach philosophy&mdash;far greater to live it. The
      highest philosophy accepts the inevitable with a smile, and greets it as
      though it were desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      To be satisfied: This is wealth&mdash;success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The real philosopher knows that everything has happened that could have
      happened&mdash;consequently he accepts. He is glad that he has lived&mdash;glad
      that he has had his moment on the stage. In this spirit Whitman has
      accepted life.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "I shall go forth,
  I shall traverse the States awhile, but I cannot tell whither or how long,
  Perhaps soon some day or night while I am singing my v
  voice will suddenly cease.
  O book, O chants! must all then amount to but this?
  Must we barely arrive at this beginning of us?&mdash;and yet it is enough, O soul;
  O soul, we have positively appear'd&mdash;that is enough."
</pre>
    <p>
      Yes, Walt Whitman has appeared. He has his place upon the stage. The drama
      is not ended. His voice is still heard. He is the Poet of Democracy&mdash;of
      all people. He is the poet of the body and soul. He has sounded the note
      of Individuality. He has given the pass-word primeval. He is the Poet of
      Humanity&mdash;of Intellectual Hospitality. He has voiced the aspirations
      of America&mdash;and, above all, he is the poet of Love and Death.
    </p>
    <p>
      How grandly, how bravely he has given his thought, and how superb is his
      farewell&mdash;his leave-taking:
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
  "After the supper and talk&mdash;after the day is done,
  As a friend from friends his final withdrawal prolonging,
  Good-bye and Good-bye with emotional lips repeating,
  (So hard for his hand to release those hands&mdash;no more will they meet,
  No more for communion of sorrow and joy, of old and young,
  A far-stretching journey awaits him, to return no more,)
  Shunning, postponing severance&mdash;seeking to ward off the last word ever so little,
  E'en at the exit-door turning&mdash;charges superfluous calling back&mdash;
  e'en as he descends the steps,
  Something to eke out a minute additional&mdash;shadows of nightfall deepening,
  Farewells, messages lessening&mdash;dimmer the forthgoer's visage and form,
  Soon to be lost for aye in the darkness&mdash;loth, O so loth to depart!"
</pre>
    <p>
      And is this all? Will the forthgoer be lost, and forever? Is death the
      end? Over the grave bends Love sobbing, and by her side stands Hope and
      whispers:
    </p>
    <p>
      We shall meet again. Before all life is death, and after all death is
      life. The falling leaf, touched with the hectic flush, that testifies of
      autumn's death, is, in a subtler sense, a prophecy of spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      Walt Whitman has dreamed great dreams, told great truths and uttered
      sublime thoughts. He has held aloft the torch and bravely led the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      As you read the marvelous book, or the person, called "Leaves of Grass,"
      you feel the freedom of the antique world; you hear the voices of the
      morning, of the first great singers&mdash;voices elemental as those of sea
      and storm. The horizon enlarges, the heavens grow ample, limitations are
      forgotten&mdash;the realization of the will, the accomplishment of the
      ideal, seem to be within your power. Obstructions become petty and
      disappear. The chains and bars are broken, and the distinctions of caste
      are lost. The soul is in the open air, under the blue and stars&mdash;the
      flag of Nature. Creeds, theories and philosophies ask to be examined,
      contradicted, reconstructed. Prejudices disappear, superstitions vanish
      and custom abdicates. The sacred places become highways, duties and
      desires clasp hands and become comrades and friends. Authority drops the
      scepter, the priest the mitre, and the purple falls from kings. The
      inanimate becomes articulate, the meanest and humblest things utter
      speech, and the dumb and voiceless burst into song. A feeling of
      independence takes possession of the soul, the body expands, the blood
      flows full and free, superiors vanish, flattery is a lost art, and life
      becomes rich, royal, and superb. The world becomes a personal possession,
      and the oceans, the continents, and constellations belong to you. You are
      in the center, everything radiates from you, and in your veins beats and
      throbs the pulse of all life. You become a rover, careless and free. You
      wander by the shores of all seas and hear the eternal psalm. You feel the
      silence of the wide forest, and stand beneath the intertwined and
      over-arching boughs, entranced with symphonies of winds and woods. You are
      borne on the tides of eager and swift rivers, hear the rush and roar of
      cataracts as they fall beneath the seven-hued arch, and watch the eagles
      as they circling soar. You traverse gorges dark and dim, and climb the
      scarred and threatening cliffs. You stand in orchards where the blossoms
      fall like snow, where the birds nest and sing, and painted moths make
      aimless journeys through the happy air. You live the lives of those who
      till the earth, and walk amid the perfumed fields, hear the reapers' song,
      and feel the breadth and scope of earth and sky. You are in the great
      cities, in the midst of multitudes, of the endless processions. You are on
      the wide plains&mdash;the prairies&mdash;with hunter and trapper, with
      savage and pioneer, and you feel the soft grass yielding under your feet.
      You sail in many ships, and breathe the free air of the sea. You travel
      many roads, and countless paths. You visit palaces and prisons, hospitals
      and courts; you pity kings and convicts, and your sympathy goes out to all
      the suffering and insane, the oppressed and enslaved, and even to the
      infamous. You hear the din of labor, all sounds of factory, field, and
      forest, of all tools, instruments and machines. You become familiar with
      men and women of all employments, trades and professions&mdash;with birth
      and burial, with wedding feast and funeral chant. You see the cloud and
      flame of war, and you enjoy the ineffable perfect days of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this one book, in these wondrous "Leaves of Grass," you find hints and
      suggestions, touches and fragments, of all there is of life that lies
      between the babe, whose rounded cheeks dimple beneath his mother's
      laughing, loving eyes, and the old man, snow-crowned, who, with a smile,
      extends his hand to death.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have met to-night to honor ourselves by honoring the author of "Leaves
      of Grass."

    <h2>
      THE GREAT INFIDELS.*
    </h2>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     * This lecture is printed from notes found among Colonel
     Ingersoll's papers, but was not revised by him for
     publication.
</pre>
    <p>
      I HAVE sometimes thought that it will not make great and splendid
      character to rock children in the cradle of hypocrisy. I do not believe
      that the tendency is to make men and women brave and glorious when you
      tell them that there are certain ideas upon certain subjects that they
      must never express; that they must go through life with a pretence as a
      shield; that their neighbors will think much more of them if they will
      only keep still; and that above all is a God who despises one who honestly
      expresses what he believes. For my part, I believe men will be nearer
      honest in business, in politics, grander in art&mdash;in everything that
      is good and grand and beautiful, if they are taught from the cradle to the
      coffin to tell their honest opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither do I believe thought to be dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is incredible that only idiots are absolutely sure of salvation. It is
      incredible that the more brain you have the less your chance is. There can
      be no danger in honest thought, and if the world ever advances beyond what
      it is to-day, it must be led by men who express their real opinions.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have passed midnight in the great struggle between Fact and Faith,
      between Science and Superstition. The brand of intellectual inferiority is
      now upon the orthodox brain. There is nothing grander than to rescue from
      the leprosy of slander the reputation of a good and generous man. Nothing
      can be nearer just than to benefit our benefactors.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Infidels of one age have been the aureoled saints of the next. The
      destroyers of the old are the creators of the new. The old passes away,
      and the new becomes old. There is in the intellectual world, as in the
      material, decay and growth, and ever by the grave of buried age stand
      youth and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The history of intellectual progress is written in the lives of Infidels.
      Political rights have been preserved by traitors&mdash;the liberty of the
      mind by heretics. To attack the king was treason&mdash;to dispute the
      priest was blasphemy. The sword and cross were allies. They defended each
      other. The throne and altar were twins&mdash;vultures from the same egg.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was James I. who said: "No bishop, no king." He might have said: "No
      cross, no crown."
    </p>
    <p>
      The king owned the bodies, and the priest the souls, of men. One lived on
      taxes, the other on alms. One was a robber, the other a beggar, and each
      was both.
    </p>
    <p>
      These robbers and beggars controlled two worlds. The king made laws, the
      priest made creeds. With bowed backs the people received the burdens of
      the one, and with wonder's open mouth the dogmas of the other. If any
      aspired to be free they were crushed by the king, and every priest was a
      Herod who slaughtered the children of the brain. The king ruled by force,
      the priest by fear, and both by both.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king said to the people: "God made you peasants, and he made me king.
      He made rags and hovels for you, robes and palaces for me. Such is the
      justice of God." And the priest said: "God made you ignorant and vile. He
      made me holy and wise. If you do not obey me, God will punish you here and
      torment you hereafter. Such is the mercy of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Infidels are intellectual discoverers. They sail the unknown seas and find
      new isles and continents in the infinite realms of thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      An Infidel is one who has found a new fact, who has an idea of his own,
      and who in the mental sky has seen another star.
    </p>
    <p>
      He is an intellectual capitalist, and for that reason excites the envy and
      hatred of the theological pauper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Origin of god and Heaven, Of the Devil and Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      IN the estimation of good orthodox Christians I am a criminal, because I
      am trying to take from loving mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters,
      husbands, wives, and lovers the consolations naturally arising from a
      belief in an eternity of grief and pain. I want to tear, break, and
      scatter to the winds the God that priests erected in the fields of
      innocent pleasure&mdash;a God made of sticks called creeds, and of old
      clothes called myths. I shall endeavor to take from the coffin its horror,
      from the cradle its curse, and put out the fires of revenge kindled by an
      infinite fiend.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it necessary that Heaven should borrow its light from the glare of
      Hell?
    </p>
    <p>
      Infinite punishment is infinite cruelty, endless injustice, immortal
      meanness. To worship an eternal goaler hardens, debases, and pollutes even
      the vilest soul. While there is one sad and breaking heart in the
      universe, no good being can be perfectly happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the heartlessness of the Christian religion every grand and tender
      soul should enter solemn protest. The God of Hell should be held in
      loathing, contempt and scorn. A God who threatens eternal pain should be
      hated, not loved&mdash;cursed, not worshiped. A heaven presided over by
      such a God must be below the lowest hell. I want no part in any heaven in
      which the saved, the ransomed and redeemed will drown with shouts of joy
      the cries and sobs of hell&mdash;in which happiness will forget misery,
      where the tears of the lost only increase laughter and double bliss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea of hell was born of ignorance, brutality, fear, cowardice, and
      revenge. This idea testifies that our remote ancestors were the lowest
      beasts. Only from dens, lairs, and caves, only from mouths filled with
      cruel fangs, only from hearts of fear and hatred, only from the conscience
      of hunger and lust, only from the lowest and most debased could come this
      most cruel, heartless and bestial of all dogmas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our barbarian ancestors knew but little of nature. They were too
      astonished to investigate. They could not divest themselves of the idea
      that everything happened with reference to them; that they caused storms
      and earthquakes; that they brought the tempest and the whirlwind; that on
      account of something they had done, or omitted to do, the lightning of
      vengeance leaped from the darkened sky. They made up their minds that at
      least two vast and powerful beings presided over this world; that one was
      good and the other bad; that both of these beings wished to get control of
      the souls of men; that they were relentless enemies, eternal foes; that
      both welcomed recruits and hated deserters; that both demanded praise and
      worship; that one offered rewards in this world, and the other in the
      next. The Devil has paid cash&mdash;God buys on credit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Man saw cruelty and mercy in nature, because he imagined that phenomena
      were produced to punish or to reward him. When his poor hut was torn and
      broken by the wind, he thought it a punishment. When some town or city was
      swept away by flood or sea, he imagined that the crimes of the inhabitants
      had been avenged. When the land was filled with plenty, when the seasons
      were kind, he thought that he had pleased the tyrant of the skies.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be remembered that both gods and devils were supposed to be
      presided over by the greatest God and the greatest Devil. The God could
      give infinite rewards and could inflict infinite torments. The Devil could
      assist man here; could give him wealth and place in this world, in
      consideration of owning his soul hereafter. Each human soul was a prize
      contended for by these deities. Of course this God and this Devil had
      innumerable spirits at their command, to execute their decrees. The God
      lived in heaven and the Devil in hell. Both were mon-archs and were
      infinitely jealous of each other. The priests pretended to be the agents
      and recruiting sergeants of this God, and they were duly authorized to
      promise and threaten in his name; they had power to forgive and curse.
      These priests sought to govern the world by force and fear. Believing that
      men could be frightened into obedience, they magnified the tortures and
      terrors of perdition. Believing also that man could in part be influenced
      by the hope of reward, they magnified the joys of heaven. In other words,
      they promised eternal joy and threatened everlasting pain. Most of these
      priests, born of the ignorance of the time, believed what they taught.
      They proved that God was good by sunlight and harvest, by health and
      happiness; that he was angry, by disease and death. Man, according to this
      doctrine, was led astray by the Devil, who delighted only in evil. It was
      supposed that God demanded worship; that he loved to be flattered; that he
      delighted in sacrifice; that nothing made him happier than to see ignorant
      faith upon its knees; that above all things he hated and despised doubters
      and heretics, and that he regarded all investigation as rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then believers in these ideas, those who had gained great
      reputation for learning and sanctity, or had enjoyed great power, wrote
      books, and these books after a time were considered sacred. Most of them
      were written to frighten mankind, and were filled with threatenings and
      curses for unbelievers and promises for the faithful. The more frightful
      the curses, the more extravagant the promises, the more sacred the books
      were considered. All of the gods were cruel and vindictive, unforgiving
      and relentless, and the devils were substantially the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was also believed that certain things must be accepted as true, no
      matter whether they were reasonable or not; that it was pleasing to God to
      believe a certain creed, especially if it happened to be the creed of the
      majority. Each community felt it a duty to see that the enemies of God
      were converted or killed. To allow a heretic to live in peace was to
      invite the wrath of God. Every public evil&mdash;every misfortune&mdash;was
      accounted for by something the community had permitted or done. When
      epidemics appeared, brought by ignorance and welcomed by filth, the
      heretic was brought out and sacrificed to appease the vengeance of God.
      From the knowledge they had&mdash;from their premises&mdash;they reasoned
      well. They said, if God will inflict such frightful torments upon us here,
      simply for allowing a few heretics to live, what will he do with the
      heretics? Of course the heretics would be punished forever. They knew how
      cruel was the barbarian king when he had the traitor in his power. They
      had seen every horror that man could inflict on man. Of course a God could
      do more than a king. He could punish forever. The fires he would kindle
      never could be quenched. The torments he would inflict would be eternal.
      They thought the amount of punishment would be measured only by the power
      of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      These ideas were not only prevalent in what are called barbarous times,
      but they are received by the religious world of to-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      No death could be conceived more horrible than that produced by flames. To
      these flames they added eternity, and hell was produced. They exhausted
      the idea of personal torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      By putting intention behind what man called good, God was produced. By
      putting intention behind what man called bad, the Devil was created. Leave
      this "intention" out, and gods and devils fade away.
    </p>
    <p>
      If not a human being existed the sun would continue to shine, and tempests
      now and then would devastate the world; the rain would fall in pleasant
      showers, and the bow of promise would adorn the cloud; violets would
      spread their velvet bosoms to the sun, and the earthquake would devour;
      birds would sing, and daisies bloom, and roses blush, and the volcanoes
      would fill the heavens with their lurid glare; the procession of the
      seasons would not be broken, and the stars would shine just as serenely as
      though the world was filled with loving hearts and happy homes. But in the
      olden time man thought otherwise. He imagined that he was of great
      importance. Barbarians are always egotistic. They think that the stars are
      watching them; that the sun shines on their account; that the rain falls
      for them, and that gods and devils are really troubling themselves about
      their poor and ignorant souls.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days men fought for their God as they did for their king. They
      killed the enemies of both. For this their king would reward them here,
      and their God hereafter. With them it was loyalty to destroy the disloyal.
      They did not regard God as a vague "spirit," nor as an "essence" without
      body or parts, but as a being, a person, an infinite man, a king, the
      monarch of the universe, who had garments of glory for believers and robes
      of flame for the heretic and infidel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not imagine that this doctrine of hell belongs to Christianity alone.
      Nearly all religions have had this dogma for a corner-stone. Upon this
      burning foundation nearly all have built. Over the abyss of pain rose the
      glittering dome of pleasure. This world was regarded as one of trial. Here
      a God of infinite wisdom experimented with man. Between the outstretched
      paws of the Infinite the mouse, man, was allowed to play. Here man had the
      opportunity of hearing priests and kneeling in temples. Here he could read
      and hear read the sacred books. Here he could have the example of the
      pious and the counsels of the holy. Here he could build churches and
      cathedrals. Here he could burn incense, fast, wear haircloth, deny himself
      all the pleasures of life, confess to priests, count beads, be miserable
      one day in seven, make creeds, construct instruments of torture, bow
      before pictures and images, eat little square pieces of bread, sprinkle
      water on the heads of babes, shut his eyes and say words to the clouds,
      and slander and defame all who have the courage to despise superstition,
      and the goodness to tell their honest thoughts. After death, nothing could
      be done to make him better. When he should come into the presence of God,
      nothing was left except to damn him. Priests might convert him here, but
      God could do nothing there,&mdash;all of which shows how much more a
      priest can do for a soul than its creator; how much more potent is the
      example of your average Christian than that of all the angels, and how
      much superior earth is to heaven for the moral development of the soul. In
      heaven the Devil is not allowed to enter. There all are pure and perfect,
      yet they cannot influence a soul for good.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only here, on the earth, where the Devil is constantly active, only where
      his agents attack every soul, is there the slightest hope of moral
      improvement.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strange! that a world cursed by God, filled with temptations and thick
      with fiends, should be the only place where hope exists, the only place
      where man can repent, the only place where reform is possible! Strange!
      that heaven, filled with angels and presided over by God, is the only
      place where reformation is utterly impossible! Yet these are the teachings
      of all the believers in the eternity of punishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Masters frightened slaves with the threat of hell, and slaves got a kind
      of shadowy revenge by whispering back the threat. The poor have damned the
      rich and the rich the poor. The imprisoned imagined a hell for their
      gaolers; the weak built this place for the strong; the arrogant for their
      rivals; the vanquished for their victors; the priest for the thinker,
      religion for reason, superstition for science.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the meanness, all the revenge, all the selfishness, all the cruelty,
      all the hatred, all the infamy of which the heart of man is capable, grew,
      blossomed and bore fruit in this one word&mdash;Hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the nourishment of this dogma cruelty was soil, ignorance was rain,
      and fear was light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christians have placed upon the throne of the universe a God of eternal
      hate. I cannot worship a being whose vengeance is boundless, whose cruelty
      is shoreless, and whose malice is increased by the agonies he inflicts.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE APPEAL TO THE CEMETERY.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHOEVER attacks a custom or a creed, will be confronted with a list of the
      names of the dead who upheld the custom, or believed the creed. He is
      asked in a very triumphant and sneering way, if he knows more than all the
      great and honored of the past Every defender of a creed has graven upon
      his memory the names of all "great" men whose actions or words can be
      tortured into evidence for his doctrine. The church is always anxious to
      have some king or president certify to the moral character of Christ, the
      authority of the Scriptures, and the justice of the Jewish God. Of late
      years, confessions of gentlemen about to be hanged have been considered of
      great value, and the scaffold is regarded as a means of grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the churches of our day seek the rich. They are no longer the friends
      and defenders of the poor. Poverty no longer feels at home in the house of
      God. In the Temple of the Most High, garments out of fashion are
      considered out of place. People now, before confessing to God what
      worthless souls they have, enrich their bodies. Now words of penitence
      mingle with the rustle of silk, and light thrown from diamonds adorns the
      repentant tear. We are told that the rich, the fortunate, the holders of
      place and office, the fashionable, the respectable, are all within the
      churches. And yet all these people grow eloquent over the poverty of
      Christ&mdash;boast that he was born in a manger&mdash;that the Holy Ghost
      passed by all the ladies of titled wealth and fashion and selected the
      wife of a poor and unknown mechanic for the Mother of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      They admit that all the men of Jerusalem who held high positions&mdash;all
      the people of wealth, influence and power&mdash;were the enemies of the
      Savior and held his pretensions in contempt. They admit that he had
      influence only with the poor, and that he was so utterly unknown&mdash;so
      indigent in acquaintance, that it was necessary to bribe one of his
      disciples to point him out to the police. They assert that he had done a
      great number of miracles&mdash;had cured the sick, and raised the dead&mdash;that
      he had preached to vast multitudes&mdash;had made a kind of triumphal
      entry into Jerusalem&mdash;had scourged from the temple the changers of
      money&mdash;had disputed with the doctors&mdash;and yet, notwithstanding
      all these things, he remained in the very depths of obscurity. Surely he
      and his disciples could have been met with the argument that the "great"
      dead were opposed to the new religion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apostles, it is claimed, preached the doctrines of Christ in Rome and
      Athens, and the people of those cities could have used the arguments
      against Christianity that Christians now use in its support. They could
      have asked the apostles if they were wiser than all the philosophers,
      poets, orators, and statesmen dead&mdash;if they knew more, coming as they
      did from a weak and barbarous nation, than the greatest men produced by
      the highest civilization of the known world. With what scorn would the
      Greeks listen to a barbarian's criticisms upon Socrates and Plato. How a
      Roman would laugh to hear a vagrant Hebrew attack a mythology that had
      been believed by Cato and Virgil.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every new religion has to overcome this argument of the cemetery&mdash;this
      logic of the grave. Old ideas take shelter behind a barricade of corpses
      and tombstones. They have epitaphs for battle-cries, and malign the living
      in the name of the dead. The moment, however, that a new religion
      succeeds, it becomes the old religion and uses the same argument against a
      new idea that it once so gallantly refuted. The arguments used to-day
      against what they are pleased to call infidelity would have shut the mouth
      of every religious reformer, from Christ to the founder of the last sect.
      The general objection to the new is, that it differs somewhat from the
      old, and the fact that it does differ is urged as an argument against its
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every man is forced to admit that he does not agree with all the great
      men, living or dead. The average Catholic, if not a priest, as a rule will
      admit that Sir Isaac Newton was in some things his superior, that
      Demosthenes had the advantage of him in expressing his ideas in public,
      and that as a sculptor he is far below the unknown man of whose hand and
      brain was born the Venus de Milo, but he will not, on account of these
      admissions, change his views upon the important question of
      transubstantiation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Protestants will cheerfully admit that they are inferior in brain and
      genius to some men who have lived and died in the Catholic Church; that in
      the matter of preaching funeral sermons they do not pretend to equal
      Bossuet; that their letters are not so interesting and polished as those
      of Pascal; that Torquemada excelled them in the genius of organization,
      and that for planning a massacre they would not for a moment dispute the
      palm with Catherine de Medici.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, after all these admissions, they would insist that the Pope is an
      unblushing impostor, and that the Catholic Church is a vampire fattened by
      the best blood of a thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is, that in favor of almost every sect, the names of some great
      men can be pronounced. In almost every church there have been men whose
      only weakness was their religion, and who in other directions achieved
      distinction. If you call men great because they were emperors, kings,
      noblemen, statesmen, millionaires&mdash;because they commanded vast armies
      and wielded great influence in their day, then more names can be found to
      support and prop the Church of Rome than any other Christian sect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is Protestantism willing to rest its claims upon the "great man" argument?
      Give me the ideas, the religions, not that have been advanced and believed
      by the so-called great of the past, but that will be defended and believed
      by the great souls of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gives me pleasure to say that Lord Bacon was a great man; but I do not
      for that reason abandon the Copernican system of astronomy, and insist
      that the earth is stationary. Samuel Johnson was an excellent writer of
      latinized English, but I am confident that he never saw a real ghost.
      Matthew Hale was a reasonably good judge of law, but he was mistaken about
      witches causing children to vomit crooked pins. John Wesley was quite a
      man, in a kind of religious way, but in this country few people sympathize
      with his hatred of republican government, or with his contempt for the
      Revolutionary Fathers. Sir Isaac Newton, in the domain of science, was the
      colossus of his time, but his commentary on the book of Revelation would
      hardly excite envy, even in the breast of a Spurgeon or a Talmage. Upon
      many questions, the opinions of Napoleon were of great value, and yet
      about his bed, when dying, he wanted to see burning the holy candles of
      Rome. John Calvin has been called a logician, and reasoned well from his
      premises, but the burning of Servetus did not make murder a virtue. Luther
      weakened somewhat the power of the Catholic Church, and to that extent was
      a reformer, and yet Lord Brougham affirmed that his "Table Talk" was so
      obscene that no respectable English publisher would soil paper with a
      translation. He was a kind of religious Rabelais; and yet a man can defend
      Luther in his attack upon the church without justifying his obscenity. If
      every man in the Catholic Church was a good man, that would not convince
      me that Ignatius Loyola ever met and conversed with the Virgin Mary. The
      fact is, very few men are right in everything. Great virtues may draw
      attention from defects, but they cannot sanctify them. A pebble surrounded
      by diamonds remains a common stone, and a diamond surrounded by pebbles is
      still a gem. No one should attempt to refute an argument by pronouncing
      the name of some man, unless he is willing to adopt all the ideas and
      beliefs of that man. It is better to give reasons and facts than names. An
      argument should not depend for its force upon the name of its author.
      Facts need no pedigree; logic has no heraldry, and the living should not
      be awed by the mistakes of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest men the world has produced have known but little. They had a
      few facts, mingled with mistakes without number. In some departments they
      towered above their fellows, while in others they fell below the common
      level of mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel Webster had great respect for the Scriptures, but very little for
      the claims of his creditors. Most men are strangely inconsistent. Two
      propositions were introduced into the Confederate Congress by the same
      man. One was to hoist the black flag, and the other was to prevent
      carrying the mails on Sunday. George Whitefield defended the slave trade,
      because it brought the negroes within the sound of the gospel, and gave
      them the advantage of associating with the gentlemen who stole them. And
      yet this same Whitefield believed and taught the dogma of predestination.
      Volumes might be written upon the follies and imbecilities of great men. A
      full rounded man&mdash;a man of sterling sense and natural logic&mdash;is
      just as rare as a great painter, poet, or sculptor. If you tell your
      friend that he is not a painter, that he has no genius for poetry, he will
      probably admit the truth of what you say, without feeling that he has been
      insulted in the least. But if you tell him that he is not a logician, that
      he has but little idea of the value of a fact, that he has no real
      conception of what evidence is, and that he never had an original thought
      in his life, he will cut your acquaintance. Thousands of men are most
      wonderful in mechanics, in trade, in certain professions, keen in
      business, knowing well the men among whom they live, and yet satisfied
      with religions infinitely stupid, with politics perfectly senseless, and
      they will believe that wonderful things were common long ago, such things
      as no amount of evidence could convince them had happened in their day. A
      man may be a successful merchant, lawyer, doctor, mechanic, statesman, or
      theologian without one particle of originality, and almost without the
      ability to think logically upon any subject whatever. Other men display in
      some directions the most marvelous intellectual power, astonish mankind
      with their grasp and vigor, and at the same time, upon religious subjects
      drool and drivel like David at the gates of Gath.

    <p>
      SACRED BOOKS.
    </p>
    <p>
      WE have found, at last, that other nations have sacred books much older
      than our own, and that these books and records were and are substantiated
      by traditions and monuments, by miracles and martyrs, christs and
      apostles, as well as by prophecies fulfilled. In all of these nations
      differences of opinion as to the authenticity and meaning of these books
      arose from time to time, precisely as they have done and still do with us,
      and upon these differences were founded sects that manufactured creeds.
      These sects denounced each other, and preached with the sword and
      endeavored to convince with the fagot. Our theologians were greatly
      astonished to find in other bibles the same stories, precepts, laws,
      customs and commands that adorn and stain our own. At first they accounted
      for this, by saying that these books were in part copies of the Jewish
      Scriptures, mingled with barbaric myths. To such an extent did they impose
      upon and insult probability, that they declared that all the morality of
      the world, all laws commanding right and prohibiting wrong, all ideas
      respecting the unity of a Supreme Being, were borrowed from the Jews, who
      obtained them directly from God. The Christian world asserts with warmth,
      not always born of candor, that the Bible is the source, origin, and
      fountain of law, liberty, love, charity, and justice; that it is the
      intellectual and moral sun of the world; that it alone gives happiness
      here, and alone points out the way to joy hereafter; that it contains the
      only revelation from the Infinite; that all others are the work of
      dishonest and mistaken men. They say these things in spite of the fact
      that the Jewish nation was one of the weakest and most barbaric of the
      past; in spite of the fact that the civilization of Egypt and India had
      commenced to wane before that of Palestine existed. To account for all the
      morality contained in the sacred books of the Hindus, by saying that it
      was borrowed from the wanderers in the Desert of Sinai, from the escaped
      slaves of the Egyptians, taxes to the utmost the credulity of ignorance,
      bigotry, and zeal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men who make these assertions are not superior to other men. They have
      only the facts common to all, and they must admit that these facts do not
      force the same conclusions upon all. They must admit that men equally
      honest, equally well informed as themselves, deny their premises and
      conclusions. They must admit that had they been born and educated in some
      other country, they would have had a different religion, and would have
      regarded with reverence and awe the books they now hold as false and
      foolish. Most men are followers, and implicitly rely upon the judgment of
      others. They mistake solemnity for wisdom, and regard a grave countenance
      as the titlepage and preface to a most learned volume. So they are easily
      imposed upon by forms, strange garments, and solemn ceremonies. And when
      the teaching of parents, the customs of neighbors, and the general tongue
      approve and justify a belief or creed, no matter how absurd, it is hard
      even for the strongest to hold the citadel of his soul. In each country,
      in defence of each religion, the same arguments would be urged. There is
      the same evidence in favor of the inspiration of the Koran and Bible. Both
      are substantiated in exactly the same way. It is just as wicked and
      unreasonable to be a heretic in Constantinople as in New York. To deny the
      claims of Christ and Mohammed is alike blasphemous. It all depends upon
      where you are when you make the denial. No religion has ever fallen that
      carried with it down to dumb death a solitary fact. Mistakes moulder with
      the temples in which they were taught, and countless superstitions sleep
      with their dead priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yet Christians insist that the religions of all nations that have fallen
      from wealth and power were false, with of course the solitary exception of
      the Jewish, simply because the nations teaching them dropped from their
      dying hands the swords of power. This argument drawn from the fate of
      nations proves no more than would one based upon the history of persons.
      With nations as with individuals, the struggle for life is perpetual, and
      the law of the survival of the fittest applies equally to both.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be that the fabric of our civilization will crumbling fall to
      unmeaning chaos and to formless dust, where oblivion broods and even
      memory forgets. Perhaps the blind Samson of some imprisoned force,
      released by thoughtless chance, may so wreck and strand the world that
      man, in stress and strain of want and fear, will shudderingly crawl back
      to savage and barbaric night. The time may come in which this thrilled and
      throbbing earth, shorn of all life, will in its soundless orbit wheel a
      barren star, on which the light will fall as fruitlessly as falls the gaze
      of love upon the cold, pathetic face of death.

    <p>
      FEAR.

      'T'HERE is a view quite prevalent, that in some way you can prove whether
      the theories defended or advanced by a man are right or not, by showing
      what kind of man he was, what kind of life he lived, and what manner of
      death he died.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man entertains certain opinions; he is persecuted. He refuses to change
      his mind; he is burned, and in the midst of flames cries out that he dies
      without change. Hundreds then say that he has sealed his testimony with
      his blood, and his doctrines must be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the martyrs in the history of the world are not sufficient to
      establish the correctness of an opinion. Martyrdom, as a rule, establishes
      the sincerity of the martyr,&mdash;never the correctness of his thought.
      Things are true or false in themselves. Truth cannot be affected by
      opinions; it cannot be changed, established, or affected by martyrdom. An
      error cannot be believed sincerely enough to make it a truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Christian will admit that any amount of heroism displayed by a Mormon
      is sufficient to prove that Joseph Smith was divinely inspired. All the
      courage and culture, all the poetry and art of ancient Greece, do not even
      tend to establish the truth of any myth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The testimony of the dying concerning some other world, or in regard to
      the supernatural, cannot be any better, to say the least, than that of the
      living. In the early days of Christianity a serene and intrepid death was
      regarded as a testimony in favor of the church. At that time Pagans were
      being converted to Christianity&mdash;were throwing Jupiter away and
      taking the Hebrew God instead. In the moment of death many of these
      converts, without doubt, retraced their steps and died in the faith of
      their ancestors. But whenever one died clinging to the cross of the new
      religion, this was seized upon as an evidence of the truth of the gospel.
      After a time the Christians taught that an unbeliever, one who spoke or
      wrote against their doctrines, could not meet death with composure&mdash;that
      the infidel in his last moments would necessarily be a prey to the serpent
      of remorse. For more than a thousand years they have made the "facts" to
      fit this theory. Crimes against men have been considered as nothing when
      compared with a denial of the truth of the Bible, the divinity of Christ,
      or the existence of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the theologians, God has always acted in this way. As long as
      men did nothing except to render their fellows wretched; as long as they
      only butchered and burnt the innocent and helpless, God maintained the
      strictest and most heartless neutrality; but when some honest man, some
      great and tender soul expressed a doubt as to the truth of the Scriptures,
      or prayed to the wrong God, or to the right one by the wrong name, then
      the real God leaped like a wounded tiger upon his victim, and from his
      quivering flesh tore his wretched soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no recorded instance where the uplifted hand of murder has been
      paralyzed&mdash;no truthful account in all the literature of the world of
      the innocent being shielded by God. Thousands of crimes are committed
      every day&mdash;men are this moment lying in wait for their human prey&mdash;wives
      are whipped and crushed, driven to insanity and death&mdash;little
      children begging for mercy, lifting imploring, tear-filled eyes to the
      brutal faces of fathers and mothers&mdash;sweet girls are deceived, lured,
      and outraged, but God has no time to prevent these things&mdash;no time to
      defend the good and to protect the pure. He is too busy numbering hairs
      and watching sparrows.
    </p>
    <p>
      He listens for blasphemy; looks for persons who laugh at priests; examines
      baptismal registers; watches professors in colleges who begin to doubt the
      geology of Moses and the astronomy of Joshua. He does not particularly
      object to stealing if you won't swear. A great many persons have fallen
      dead in the act of taking God's name in vain, but millions of men, women,
      and children have been stolen from their homes and used as beasts of
      burden, but no one engaged in this infamy has ever been touched by the
      wrathful hand of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      All kinds of criminals, except infidels, meet death with reasonable
      serenity. As a rule, there is nothing in the death of a pirate to cast any
      discredit on his profession. The murderer upon the scaffold, with a priest
      on either side, smilingly exhorts the multitude to meet him in heaven. The
      man who has succeeded in making his home a hell, meets death without a
      quiver, provided he has never expressed any doubt as to the divinity of
      Christ, or the eternal "procession" of the Holy Ghost. The king who has
      waged cruel and useless war, who has filled countries with widows and
      fatherless children, with the maimed and diseased, and who has succeeded
      in offering to the Moloch of ambition the best and bravest of his
      subjects, dies like a saint.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Emperor Constantine, who lifted Christianity into power, murdered his
      wife Fausta, and his eldest son Crispus, the same year that he convened
      the Council of Nice to decide whether Jesus Christ was a man or the Son of
      God. The council decided that Christ was consubstantial with the Father.
      This was in the year 325. We are thus indebted to a wife-murderer for
      settling the vexed question of the divinity of the Savior. Theodosius
      called a council at Constantinople in 381, and this council decided that
      the Holy Ghost proceeded from the Father. Theodosius, the younger,
      assembled another council at Ephesus to ascertain who the Virgin Mary
      really was, and it was solemnly decided in the year 431 that she was the
      Mother of God. In 451 it was decided by a council held at Chalcedon,
      called together by the Emperor Marcian, that Christ had two natures&mdash;the
      human and divine. In 680, in another general council, held at
      Constantinople, convened by order of Pognatius, it was also decided that
      Christ had two wills, and in the year 1274 it was decided at the Council
      of Lyons, that the Holy Ghost proceeded not only from the Father, but from
      the Son as well. Had it not been for these councils, we might have been
      without a Trinity even unto this day. When we take into consideration the
      fact that a belief in the Trinity is absolutely essential to salvation,
      how unfortunate it was for the world that this doctrine was not
      established until the year 1274. Think of the millions that dropped into
      hell while these questions were being discussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, however, is a digression. Let us go back to Constantine. This
      Emperor, stained with every crime, is supposed to have died like a
      Christian. We hear nothing of fiends leering at him in the shadows of
      death. He does not see the forms of his murdered wife and son covered with
      the blood he shed. From his white and shrivelled lips issued no shrieks of
      terror. He does not cover his glazed eyes with thin and trembling hands to
      shut out the visions of hell. His chamber is filled with the rustle of
      wings&mdash;of wings waiting to bear his soul to the thrilling realms of
      joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Against the Emperor Constantine the church has hurled no anathema. She has
      accepted the story of his vision in the clouds, and his holy memory has
      been guarded by priest and pope. All the persecutors sleep in peace, and
      the ashes of those who burned their brothers in the name of Christ rest in
      consecrated ground. Whole libraries could not contain even the names of
      the wretches who have filled the world with violence and death in defence
      of book and creed, and yet they all died the death of the righteous, and
      no priest or minister describes the agony and fear, the remorse and
      horror, with which their guilty souls were filled in the last moments of
      their lives. These men had never doubted&mdash;they accepted the creed&mdash;they
      were not infidels&mdash;they had not denied the divinity of Christ&mdash;they
      had been baptized&mdash;they had partaken of the Last Supper&mdash;they
      had respected priests&mdash;they admitted that the Holy Ghost had
      "proceeded," and these things put pillows beneath their dying heads, and
      covered them with the drapery of peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now and then, in the history of this world, a man of genius, of sense, of
      intellectual honesty has appeared. These men have denounced the
      superstitions of their day. They pitied the multitude. To see priests
      devour the substance of the people filled them with indignation. These men
      were honest enough to tell their thoughts. Then they were denounced,
      tried, condemned, executed. Some of them escaped the fury of the people
      who loved their enemies, and died naturally in their beds.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not do for the church to admit that they died peacefully. That
      would show that religion was not actually necessary in the last moment.
      Religion got much of its power from the terror of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE DEATH TEST.
    </p>
    <p>
      YOU had better live well and die wicked.
    </p>
    <p>
      You had better live well and die cursing than live badly and die praying.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would not do to have the common people understand that a man could deny
      the Bible, refuse to look at the cross, contend that Christ was only a
      man, and yet die as calmly as Calvin did after he had murdered Servetus,
      or as did King David after advising one son to kill another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church has taken great pains to show that the last moments of all
      infidels (that Christians did not succeed in burning) were infinitely
      wretched and despairing. It was alleged that words could not paint the
      horrors that were endured by a dying infidel. Every good Christian was
      expected to, and generally did, believe these accounts. They have been
      told and retold in every pulpit of the world. Protestant ministers have
      repeated the inventions of Catholic priests, and Catholics, by a kind of
      theological comity, have sworn to the falsehoods told by Protestants. Upon
      this point they have always stood together, and will as long as the same
      calumny can be used by both.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the death-bed subject the clergy grow eloquent. When describing the
      shudderings and shrieks of the dying unbeliever, their eyes glitter with
      delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a festival.
    </p>
    <p>
      They are no longer men. They become hyenas. They dig open graves. They
      devour the reputations of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a banquet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unsatisfied still, they paint the terrors of hell. They gaze at the souls
      of the infidels writhing in the coils of the worm that never dies. They
      see them in flames&mdash;in oceans of fire&mdash;in gulfs of pain&mdash;in
      abysses of despair. They shout with joy. They applaud.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is an <i>auto da fe</i>, presided over by God and his angels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men they thus describe were not atheists; they were all believers in
      God, in special providence, and in the immortality of the soul. They
      believed in the accountability of man&mdash;in the practice of virtue, in
      justice, and liberty, but they did not believe in that collection of
      follies and fables called the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to show that an infidel must die overwhelmed with remorse and
      fear, they have generally selected from all the "unbelievers" since the
      day of Christ five men&mdash;the Emperor Julian, Spinoza, Voltaire,
      Diderot, David Hume, and Thomas Paine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hardly a minister in the United States has attempted to "answer" me
      without referring to the death of one or more of these men.
    </p>
    <p>
      In vain have these calumniators of the dead been called upon to prove
      their statements. In vain have rewards been offered to any priestly
      maligner to bring forward the evidence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us once for all dispose of these slanders&mdash;of these pious
      calumnies.
    </p>
    <p>
      JULIAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      THEY say that the Emperor Julian was an apostate that he was once a
      Christian; that he fell from grace, and that in his last moments, throwing
      some of his own blood into the air, he cried out to Jesus Christ,
      "Galilean, thou hast conquered!"
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be remembered that the Christians had persecuted and imprisoned
      this very Julian; that they had exiled him; that they had threatened him
      with death. Many of his relatives were murdered by the Christians. He
      became emperor, and Christians conspired to take his life. The
      conspirators were discovered and they were pardoned. He did what he could
      to prevent the Christians from destroying each other. He held pomp and
      pride and luxury in contempt, and led his army on foot, sharing the
      privations of the meanest soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon ascending the throne he published an edict proclaiming universal
      religious toleration. He was then a Pagan. It is claimed by some that he
      never did entirely forget his Christian education. In this I am inclined
      to think there is some truth, because he revoked his edict of toleration,
      and for a time was nearly as unjust as though he had been a saint. He was
      emperor one year and seven months. In a battle with the Persians he was
      mortally wounded. "Brought back to his tent, and feeling that he had but a
      short time to live, he spent his last hours in discoursing with his
      friends on the immortality of the soul. He reviewed his reign and declared
      that he was satisfied with his conduct, and had neither penitence nor
      remorse to express for anything that he had done." His last words were: "I
      submit willingly to the eternal decrees of heaven, convinced that he who
      is captivated with life, when his last hour has arrived is more weak and
      pusillanimous than he who would rush to voluntary death when it is his
      duty still to live."
    </p>
    <p>
      When we remember that a Christian emperor murdered Julian's father and
      most of his kindred, and that he narrowly escaped the same fate, we can
      hardly blame him for having a little prejudice against a church whose
      members were fierce, ignorant, and bloody&mdash;whose priests were
      hypocrites, and whose bishops were assassins. If Julian had said he was a
      Christian&mdash;no matter what he actually was, he would have satisfied
      the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story that the dying emperor acknowledged that he was conquered by the
      Galilean was originated by some of the so-called Fathers of the Church,
      probably by Gregory or Theodoret. They are the same wretches who said that
      Julian sacrificed a woman to the moon, tearing out her entrails with his
      own hands. We are also informed by these hypocrites that he endeavored to
      rebuild the temple of Jerusalem, and that fire came out of the earth and
      consumed the laborers employed in the sacrilegious undertaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did not suppose that an intelligent man could be found in the world who
      believed this childish fable, and yet in the January number for 1880, of
      the <i>Princeton Review</i>, the Rev. Stuart Robinson (whoever he may be)
      distinctly certifies to the truth of this story. He says: "Throughout the
      entire era of the planting of the Christian Church, the gospel preached
      was assailed not only by the malignant fanaticism of the Jew and the
      violence of Roman statecraft, but also by the intellectual weapons of
      philosophers, wits, and poets. Now Celsus denounced the new religion as
      base imposture. Now Tacitus described it as but another phase of the <i>odium
      generis humani. Now Julian proposed to bring into contempt the prophetic
      claims of its founder by the practical test of rebuilding the Temple</i>."
      Here then in the year of grace 1880 is a Presbyterian preacher, who really
      believes that Julian tried to rebuild the Temple, and that God caused fire
      to issue from the earth and consume the innocent workmen.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these stories rest upon the same foundation&mdash;the mendacity of
      priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Julian changed the religion of the Empire, and diverted the revenues of
      the church. Whoever steps between a priest and his salary, will find that
      he has committed every crime. No matter how often the slanders may be
      refuted, they will be repeated until the last priest has lost his body and
      found his wings. These falsehoods about Julian were invented some fifteen
      hundred years ago, and they are repeated to-day by just as honest and just
      as respectable people as those who told them at first. Whenever the church
      cannot answer the arguments of an opponent, she attacks his character. She
      resorts to falsehood, and in the domain of calumny she has stood for
      fifteen hundred years without a rival.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great Empire was crumbling to its fall. The literature of the world
      was being destroyed by priests. The gods and goddesses were driven from
      the earth and sky. The paintings were torn and defaced. The statues were
      broken. The walls were left desolate, and the niches empty. Art, like
      Rachel, wept for her children, and would not be comforted. The streams and
      forests were deserted by the children of the imagination, and the whole
      earth was barren, poor and mean.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian ignorance, bigotry and hatred, in blind unreasoning zeal, had
      destroyed the treasures of our race. Art was abhorred, Knowledge was
      despised, Reason was an outcast. The sun was blotted from the intellectual
      heaven, every star extinguished, and there fell upon the world that shadow&mdash;that
      midnight,&mdash;known as "The Dark Ages."
    </p>
    <p>
      This night lasted for a thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
      The First Great Star&mdash;Herald of the Dawn&mdash;was Bruno.
    </p>
    <p>
      BRUNO.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE night of the Middle Ages lasted for a thousand years. The first star
      that enriched the horizon of this universal gloom was Giordano Bruno. He
      was the herald of the dawn.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was born in 1550, was educated for a priest, became a Dominican friar.
      At last his reason revolted against the doctrine of transubstantiation. He
      could not believe that the entire Trinity was in a wafer, or in a swallow
      of wine. He could not believe that a man could devour the Creator of the
      universe by eating a piece of bread. This led him to investigate other
      dogmas of the Catholic Church, and in every direction he found the same
      contradictions and impossibilities supported, not by reason, but by faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those who loved their enemies threatened his life. He was obliged to flee
      from his native land, and he became a vagabond in nearly every nation of
      Europe. He declared that he fought, not what priests believed, but what
      they pretended to believe. He was driven from his native country because
      of his astronomical opinions. He had lost confidence in the Bible as a
      scientific work. He was in danger because he had discovered a truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fled to England. He gave some lectures at Oxford. He found that
      institution controlled by priests. He found that they were teaching
      nothing of importance&mdash;only the impossible and the hurtful. He called
      Oxford "the widow of true learning." There were in England, at that time,
      two men who knew more than the rest of the world. Shakespeare was then
      alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bruno was driven from England. He was regarded as a dangerous man,&mdash;he
      had opinions, he inquired after reasons, he expressed confidence in facts.
      He fled to France. He was not allowed to remain in that country. He
      discussed things&mdash;that was enough. The church said, "move on." He
      went to Germany. He was not a believer&mdash;he was an investigator. The
      Germans wanted believers; they regarded the whole Christian system as
      settled; they wanted witnesses; they wanted men who would assert. So he
      was driven from Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      He returned at last to his native land. He found himself without friends,
      because he had been true, not only to himself, but to the human race. But
      the world was false to him because he refused to crucify the Christ of his
      own soul between the two thieves of hypocrisy and bigotry. He was arrested
      for teaching that there are other worlds than this; that many of the stars
      are suns, around which other worlds revolve; that Nature did not exhaust
      all her energies on this grain of sand called the earth. He believed in a
      plurality of worlds, in the rotation of this, in the heliocentric theory.
      For these crimes, and for these alone, he was imprisoned for six years. He
      was kept in solitary confinement. He was allowed no books, no friends, no
      visitors. He was denied pen and paper. In the darkness, in the loneliness,
      he had time to examine the great questions of origin, of existence, of
      destiny. He put to the test what is called the goodness of God. He found
      that he could neither depend upon man nor upon any deity. At last, the
      Inquisition demanded him. He was tried, condemned, excommunicated and
      sentenced to be burned. According to Professor Draper, he believed that
      this world is animated by an intelligent soul&mdash;the cause of forms,
      but not of matter; that it lives in all things, even in such as seem not
      to live; that everything is ready to become organized; that matter is the
      mother of forms, and then their grave; that matter and the soul of things,
      together, constitute God. He was a pantheist&mdash;that is to say, an
      atheist. He was a lover of Nature,&mdash;a reaction from the asceticism of
      the church. He was tired of the gloom of the monastery. He loved the
      fields, the woods, the streams. He said to his brother-priests: Come out
      of your cells, out of your dungeons: come into the air and light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throw away your beads and your crosses. Gather flowers; mingle with your
      fellow-men; have wives and children; scatter the seeds of joy; throw away
      the thorns and nettles of your creeds; enjoy the perpetual miracle of
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the sixteenth day of February, in the year of grace 1600, by "the
      triumphant beast," the Church of Rome, this philosopher, this great and
      splendid man, was burned. He was offered his liberty if he would recant.
      There was no God to be offended by his recantation, and yet, as an apostle
      of what he believed to be the truth, he refused this offer. To those who
      passed the sentence upon him he said: "It is with greater fear that ye
      pass this sentence upon me than I receive it." This man, greater than any
      naturalist of his day; grander than the martyr of any religion, died
      willingly in defence of what he believed to be the sacred truth. He was
      great enough to know that real religion will not destroy the joy of life
      on earth; great enough to know that investigation is not a crime&mdash;that
      the really useful is not hidden in the mysteries of faith. He knew that
      the Jewish records were below the level of the Greek and Roman myths; that
      there is no such thing as special providence; that prayer is useless; that
      liberty and necessity are the same, and that good and evil are but
      relative.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the first real martyr,&mdash;neither frightened by perdition, nor
      bribed by heaven. He was the first of all the world who died for truth
      without expectation of reward. He did not anticipate a crown of glory. His
      imagination had not peopled the heavens with angels waiting for his soul.
      He had not been promised an eternity of joy if he stood firm, nor had he
      been threatened with the fires of hell if he wavered and recanted. He
      expected as his reward an eternal nothing! Death was to him an everlasting
      end&mdash;nothing beyond but a sleep without a dream, a night without a
      star, without a dawn&mdash;nothing but extinction, blank, utter, and
      eternal. No crown, no palm, no "well done, good and faithful servant," no
      shout of welcome, no song of praise, no smile of God, no kiss of Christ,
      no mansion in the fair skies&mdash;not even a grave within the earth&mdash;nothing
      but ashes, wind-blown and priest-scattered, mixed with earth and trampled
      beneath the feet of men and beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murder of this man will never be completely and perfectly avenged
      until from Rome shall be swept every vestige of priest and pope, until
      over the shapeless ruin of St. Peter's, the crumbled Vatican and the
      fallen cross, shall rise a monument to Bruno,&mdash;the thinker,

      THE CHURCH IN THE TIME OF VOLTAIRE.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEN Voltaire was born, the natural was about the only thing in which the
      church did not believe. The monks sold little amulets of consecrated
      paper. They would cure diseases. If laid in a cradle they would prevent a
      child being bewitched. So, they could be put into houses and barns to keep
      devils away, or buried in a field to prevent bad weather, to delay frost,
      and to insure good crops. There was a regular formulary by which they were
      made, ending with a prayer, after which the amulets were sprinkled with
      holy water. The church contended that its servants were the only
      legitimate physicians. The priests cured in the name of the church, and in
      the name of God, by exorcism, relics, water, salt, and oil. St. Valentine
      cured epilepsy, St. Gervasius was good for rheumatism, St. Michael de
      Sanatis for cancer, St. Judas for coughs, St. Ovidius for deafness, St.
      Sebastian for poisonous bites, St. Apollonia for toothache, St. Clara for
      rheum in the eye, St. Hubert for hydrophobia. Devils were driven out with
      wax tapers, with incense, with holy water, by pronouncing prayers. The
      church, as late as the middle of the twelfth century, prohibited good
      Catholics from having anything to do with physicians.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was believed that the devils produced storms of wind, of rain and of
      fire from heaven; that the atmosphere was a battlefield between angels and
      devils; that Lucifer had power to destroy fields and vineyards and
      dwellings, and the principal business of the church was to protect the
      people from the Devil. This was the origin of church bells. These bells
      were sprinkled with holy water, and their clangor cleared the air of imps
      and fiends. The bells also prevented storms and lightning. The church used
      to anathematize insects. In the sixteenth century, regular suits were
      commenced against rats, and judgment was rendered. Every monastery had its
      master magician, who sold magic incense, salt, and tapers, consecrated
      palms and relics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every science was regarded as an outcast, an enemy. Every fact held the
      creed of the church in scorn. Investigators were enemies in disguise.
      Thinkers were traitors, and the church exerted its vast power for
      centuries to prevent the intellectual progress of man. There was no
      liberty, no education, no philosophy, no science; nothing but credulity,
      ignorance, and superstition. The world was really under the control of
      Satan and his agents. The church, for the purpose of increasing her power,
      exhausted every means to convince the people of the existence of witches,
      devils, and fiends. In this way the church had every enemy within her
      power. She simply had to charge him with being a wizard, of holding
      communication with devils, and the ignorant mob were ready to tear him to
      pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      To such an extent was this frightful course pursued, and such was the
      prevalence of the belief in the supernatural, that the worship of the
      devil was absolutely established. The poor people, brutalized by the
      church, filled with fear of Satanic influence, finding that the church did
      not protect, as a last resort began to worship the Devil. The power of the
      Devil was proven by the Bible. The history of Job, the temptation of
      Christ in the desert, the carrying of Christ to the top of the temple, and
      hundreds of other instances, were relied upon as establishing his power;
      and when people laughed about witches riding upon anointed sticks in the
      air, invisible, they were reminded of a like voyage when the Devil carried
      Jesus to the pinnacle of the temple.
    </p>
    <p>
      This frightful doctrine filled every friend with suspicion of his friend.
      It the husband denounce the wife, the children the parents, and the
      parents the children It destroyed all the sweet relations of humanity. It
      did away with justice in the courts. It destroyed the charity of religion.
      It broke the bond of friendship. It filled with poison the golden cup of
      life. It turned earth into a very hell, peopled with ignorant, tyrannical,
      and malicious demons.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the result of a few centuries of Christianity. Such was the
      result of a belief in the supernatural. Such was the result of giving up
      the evidence of our own senses, and relying upon dreams, visions, and
      fears. Such was the result of destroying human reason, of depending upon
      the supernatural, of living here for another world instead of for this, of
      depending upon priests instead of upon ourselves. The Protestants vied
      with the Catholics. Luther stood side by side with the priests he had
      deserted, in promoting this belief in devils and fiends. To the Catholic,
      every Protestant was possessed by a devil. To the Protestant, every
      Catholic was the homestead of a fiend. All order, all regular succession
      of causes and effects, were known no more. The natural ceased to exist.
      The learned and the ignorant were on a level. The priest had been caught
      in the net spread for the peasant, and Christendom was a vast madhouse,
      with insane priests for keepers.
    </p>
    <p>
      VOLTAIRE
    </p>
    <p>
      WHEN Voltaire was born, the church ruled and owned France. It was a period
      of almost universal corruption. The priests were mostly libertines. The
      judges were nearly as cruel as venal. The royal palace was simply a house
      of assignation. The nobles were heartless, proud, arrogant, and cruel to
      the last degree. The common people were treated as beasts. It took the
      church a thousand years to bring about this happy condition of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      The seeds of the revolution unconsciously were being scattered by every
      noble and by every priest. They germinated in the hearts of the helpless.
      They were watered by the tears of agony. Blows began to bear interest.
      There was a faint longing for blood. Workmen, blackened by the sun, bent
      by labor, looked at the white throats of scornful ladies and thought about
      cutting them.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those days witnesses were cross-examined with instruments of torture.
      The church was the arsenal of superstition. Miracles, relics, angels and
      devils were as common as rags. Voltaire laughed at the evidences, attacked
      the pretended facts, held the Bible up to ridicule, and filled Europe with
      indignant protests against the cruelty, bigotry, and injustice of the
      time.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was a believer in God, and in some ingenious way excused this God for
      allowing the Catholic Church to exist. He had an idea that, originally,
      mankind were believers in one God, and practiced all the virtues. Of
      course this was a mistake. He imagined that the church had corrupted the
      human race. In this he was right.
    </p>
    <p>
      It may be that, at one time, the church relatively stood for progress, but
      when it gained power, it became an obstruction. The system of Voltaire was
      contradictory. He described a being of infinite goodness, who not only
      destroyed his children with pestilence and famine, but allowed them to
      destroy each other. While rejecting the God of the Bible, he accepted
      another God, who, to say the least, allowed the innocent to be burned for
      love of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire hated tyranny, and loved liberty. His arguments to prove the
      existence of a God were just as groundless as those of the reverend
      fathers of his day to prove the divinity of Christ, or that Mary was the
      mother of God. The theologians of his time maligned and feared him. He
      regarded them as a spider does flies. He spread nets for them. They were
      caught, and he devoured them for the amusement and benefit of the public.
      He was educated by the Jesuits, and sometimes acted like one.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is fashionable to say that he was not profound, This is because he was
      not stupid. In the presence of absurdity he laughed, and was called
      irreverent. He thought God would not damn even a priest forever: this was
      regarded as blasphemy. He endeavored to prevent Christians from murdering
      each other and did what he could to civilize the disciples of Christ. Had
      he founded a sect, obtained control of some country, and burned a few
      heretics at slow fires, he would have won the admiration, respect and love
      of the Christian world. Had he only pretended to believe all the fables of
      antiquity, had he mumbled Latin prayers, counted beads, crossed himself,
      devoured the flesh of God, and carried fagots to the feet of philosophy in
      the name of Christ, he might have been in heaven this moment, enjoying a
      sight of the damned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of doing these things, he willfully closed his eyes to the light
      of the gospel, examined the Bible for himself, advocated intellectual
      liberty, struck from the brain the fetters of an arrogant faith, assisted
      the weak, cried out against the torture of man, appealed to reason,
      endeavored to establish universal toleration, succored the indigent, and
      defended the oppressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      These were his crimes. Such a man God would not suffer to die in peace. If
      allowed to meet death with a smile, others might follow his example, until
      none would be left to light the holy fires of the auto da fe. It would not
      do for so great, so successful an enemy of the church, to die without
      leaving some shriek of fear, some shudder of remorse, some ghastly prayer
      of chattered horror, uttered by lips covered with blood and foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was an old man of eighty-four. He had been surrounded with the comforts
      of life; he was a man of wealth, of genius. Among the literary men of the
      world he stood first. God had allowed him to have the appearance of
      success. His last years were filled with the intoxication of flattery. He
      stood at the summit of his age.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests became anxious. They began to fear that God would forget, in a
      multiplicity of business, to make a terrible example of Voltaire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toward the last of May, 1778, it was whispered in Paris that Voltaire was
      dying. Upon the fences of expectation gathered the unclean birds of
      superstition, impatiently waiting for their prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Two days before his death, his nephew went to seek the cur&eacute; of
      Saint Sulpice and the Abb&eacute; Gautier and brought them into his
      uncle's sick chamber, who was informed that they were there. 'Ah, well!'
      said Voltaire, 'give them my compliments and my thanks.' The Abb&eacute;
      spoke some words to him, exhorting him to patience. The cur&eacute; of
      Saint Sulpice then came forward, having announced himself, and asked of
      Voltaire, elevating his voice, if he acknowledged the divinity of our Lord
      Jesus Christ. The sick man pushed one of his hands against the cur&eacute;'s
      coif, shoving him back, and cried, turning abruptly to the other side,
      'Let me die in peace.' The cur&eacute; seemingly considered his person
      soiled, and his coif dishonored, by the touch of the philosopher. He made
      the nurse give him a little brushing, and went out with the Abb&eacute;
      Gautier."
    </p>
    <p>
      He expired, says Wagniere, on the 30th of May, 1778, at about a quarter
      past eleven at night, with the most perfect tranquillity. Ten minutes
      before his last breath he took the hand of Morand, his <i>valet de chambre</i>,
      who was watching by him, pressed it and said: "Adieu, my dear Morand, I am
      gone." These were his last words.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this death, so simple and serene, so natural and peaceful; from these
      words so utterly destitute of cant or dramatic touch, all the frightful
      pictures, all the despairing utterances, have been drawn and made. From
      these materials, and from these alone, have been constructed all the
      shameless lies about The death of this great and wonderful man, compared
      with whom all of his calumniators, dead and living, were and are but dust
      and vermin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Voltaire was the intellectual autocrat of his time. From his throne at the
      foot of the Alps he pointed the finger of scorn at every hypocrite in
      Europe. He was the pioneer of his century. He was the assassin of
      superstition. He left the quiver of ridicule without an arrow. Through the
      shadows of faith and fable, through the darkness of myth and miracle,
      through the midnight of Christianity, through the blackness of bigotry,
      past cathedral and dungeon, past rack and stake, past altar and throne, he
      carried, with chivalric hands, the sacred torch of reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIDEROT. DOUBT IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD TRUTH.
    </p>
    <p>
      DIDEROT was born in 1713. His parents were in what may be called the
      humbler walks of life. Like Voltaire he was educated by the Jesuits. He
      had in him something of the vagabond, and was for several years almost a
      beggar in Paris. He was endeavoring to live by his pen. In that day and
      generation, a man without a patron, endeavoring to live by literature, was
      necessarily almost a beggar. He nearly starved&mdash;frequently going for
      days without food. Afterward, when he had something himself, he was as
      generous as the air. No man ever was more willing to give, and no man less
      willing to receive, than Diderot.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wrote upon all conceivable subjects, that he might have bread. He even
      wrote sermons, and regretted it all his life. He and D'Alembert were the
      life and soul of the Encyclopaedia. With infinite enthusiasm he helped to
      gather the knowledge of the world for the use of each and all. He
      harvested the fields of thought, separated the grain from the straw and
      chaff, and endeavored to throw away the seeds and fruit of superstition.
      His motto was, "<i>Incredulity is the first step towards philosophy</i>."
    </p>
    <p>
      He had the vices of most Christians&mdash;was nearly as immoral as the
      majority of priests. His vices he shared in common, his virtues were his
      own. All who knew him united in saying that he had the pity of a woman,
      the generosity of a prince, the self-denial of an anchorite, the courage
      of C&aelig;sar, and the enthusiasm of a poet. He attacked with every power
      of his mind the superstition of his day. He said what he thought. The
      priests hated him. He was in favor of universal education&mdash;the church
      despised it. He wished to put the knowledge of the whole world within
      reach of the poorest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished to drive from the gate of the Garden of Eden the cherubim of
      superstition, so that the child of Adam might return to eat once more the
      fruit of the tree of knowledge. Every Catholic was his enemy. His poor
      little desk was ransacked by the police searching for manuscripts in which
      something might be found that would justify the imprisonment of such a
      dangerous man. Whoever, in 1750, wished to increase the knowledge of
      mankind was regarded as the enemy of social order.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intellectual superstructure of France rests upon the Encyclopaedia.
      The knowledge given to the people was the impulse, the commencement, of
      the revolution that left the church without an altar and the king without
      a throne. Diderot thought for himself, and bravely gave his thoughts to
      others. For this reason he was regarded as a criminal. He did not expect
      his reward in another world. He did not do what he did to please some
      imaginary God. He labored for mankind. He wished to lighten the burdens of
      those who should live after him. Hear these noble words:
    </p>
    <p>
      "The more man ascends through the past, and the more he launches into the
      future, the greater he will be, and all these philosophers and ministers
      and truth-telling men who have fallen victims to the stupidity of nations,
      the atrocities of priests, the fury of tyrants, what consolation was left
      for them in death? This: That prejudice would pass, and that posterity
      would pour out the vial of ignominy upon their enemies. O Posterity! Holy
      and sacred stay of the unhappy and the oppressed; thou who art just, thou
      who art incorruptible, thou who findest the good man, who unmaskest the
      hypocrite, who breakest down the tyrant, may thy sure faith, thy consoling
      faith never, never abandon me!" Posterity is for the philosopher what the
      other world is for the devotee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diderot took the ground that, if orthodox religion be true Christ was
      guilty of suicide. Having the power to defend himself he should have used
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course it would not do for the church to allow a man to die in peace
      who had added to the intellectual wealth of the world. The moment Diderot
      was dead, Catholic priests began painting and recounting the horrors of
      his expiring moments. They described him as overcome with remorse, as
      insane with fear; and these falsehoods have been repeated by the
      Protestant world, and will probably be repeated by thousands of ministers
      after we are dead. The truth is, he had passed his three-score years and
      ten. He had lived for seventy-one years. He had eaten his supper. He had
      been conversing with his wife. He was reclining in his easy chair. His
      mind was at perfect rest. He had entered, without knowing it, the twilight
      of his last day. Above the horizon was the evening star, telling of sleep.
      The room grew still and the stillness was lulled by the murmur of the
      street. There were a few moments of perfect peace. The wife said, "He is
      asleep." She enjoyed his repose, and breathed softly that he might not be
      disturbed. The moments wore on, and still he slept. Lovingly, softly, at
      last she touched him. Yes, he was asleep. He had become a part of the
      eternal silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      DAVID HUME.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE worst religion of the world was the Presbyterianism of Scotland as it
      existed in the beginning of the eighteenth century. The Kirk had all the
      faults of the Church of Rome without a redeeming feature. The Kirk hated
      music, painting, statuary, and architecture. Anything touched with
      humanity&mdash;with the dimples of joy&mdash;was detested and accursed.
      God was to be feared&mdash;not loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life was a long battle with the Devil. Every desire was of Satan.
      Happiness was a snare, and human love was wicked, weak and vain. The
      Presbyterian priest of Scotland was as cruel, bigoted and heartless as the
      familiar of the Inquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
      One case will tell it all:
    </p>
    <p>
      In the beginning of this, the nineteenth century, a boy seventeen years of
      age, Thomas Aikenhead, was indicted and tried at Edinburgh for blasphemy.
      He had denied the inspiration of the Bible. He had on several occasions,
      when cold, jocularly wished himself in hell that he might get warm. The
      poor, frightened boy recanted&mdash;begged for mercy; but he was found
      guilty, hanged, thrown in a hole at the foot of the scaffold, and his
      weeping mother vainly begged that his bruised and bleeding body might be
      given to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      This one case, multiplied again and again, gives you the condition of
      Scotland when, on the 26th of April, 1711, David Hume was born.
    </p>
    <p>
      David Hume was one of the few Scotchmen of his day who were not owned by
      the church. He had the manliness to examine historical and religious
      questions for himself, and the courage to give his conclusions to the
      world. He was singularly capable of governing himself. He was a
      philosopher, and lived a calm and cheerful life, unstained by an unjust
      act, free from all excess, and devoted in a reasonable degree to
      benefiting his fellow-men. After examining the Bible he became convinced
      that it was not true. For failing to suppress his real opinion, for
      failing to tell a deliberate falsehood, he brought upon himself the hatred
      of the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intellectual honesty is the sin against the Holy Ghost, and whether God
      will forgive this sin or not his church has not, and never will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hume took the ground that a miracle could not be used as evidence until
      the fact that it had happened was established. But how can a miracle be
      established? Take any miracle recorded in the Bible, and how could it be
      established now? You may say: Upon the testimony of those who wrote the
      account. Who were they? No one knows. How could you prove the resurrection
      of Lazarus? Or of the widow's son? How could you substantiate, today, the
      ascension of Jesus Christ? In what way could you prove that the river
      Jordan was divided upon being struck by the coat of a prophet? How is it
      possible now to establish the fact that the fires of a furnace refused to
      burn three men? Where are the witnesses? Who, upon the whole earth, has
      the slightest knowledge upon this subject?
    </p>
    <p>
      He insisted that at the bottom of all good was the useful; that human
      happiness was an end worth working and living for; that origin and destiny
      were alike unknown; that the best religion was to live temperately and to
      deal justly with our fellow-men; that the dogma of inspiration was absurd,
      and that an honest man had nothing to fear. Of course the Kirk hated him.
      He laughed at the creed.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the lot of Hume fell ease, respect, success, and honor. While many
      disciples of God were the sport and prey of misfortune, he kept steadily
      advancing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Envious Christians bided their time. They waited as patiently as possible
      for the horrors of death to fall upon the heart and brain of David Hume.
      They knew that all the furies would be there, and that God would get his
      revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam Smith, author of the "Wealth of Nations," speaking of Hume in his
      last sickness, says that in the presence of death "his cheerfulness was so
      great, and his conversation and amusements ran so much in the usual
      strain, that, notwithstanding all his bad symptoms, many people could not
      believe he was dying. A few days before his death Hume said: 'I am dying
      as fast as my enemies&mdash;if I have any&mdash;could wish, and as easily
      and tranquilly as my best friends could desire.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      Col. Edmondstoune shortly afterward wrote Hume a letter, of which the
      following is an extract:
    </p>
    <p>
      "My heart is full. I could not see you this morning. I thought it was
      better for us both. You cannot die&mdash;you must live in the memory of
      your friends and acquaintances; and your works will render you immortal. I
      cannot conceive that it was possible for any one to dislike you, or hate
      you. He must be more than savage who could be an enemy to a man with the
      best head and heart and the most amiable manners."
    </p>
    <p>
      Adam Smith happened to go into his room while he was reading the above
      letter, which he immediately showed him. Smith said to Hume that he was
      sensible of how much he was weakening, and that appearances were in many
      respects bad; yet, that his cheerfulness was so great and the spirit of
      life still seemed to be so strong in him, that he could not keep from
      entertaining some hopes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hume answered, "When I lie down in the evening I feel myself weaker than
      when I arose in the morning; and when I rise in the morning, weaker than
      when I lay down in the evening. I am sensible, besides, that some of my
      vital parts are affected so that I must soon die."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Well," said Mr. Smith, "if it must be so, you have at least the
      satisfaction of leaving all your friends, and the members of your
      brother's family in particular, in great prosperity."
    </p>
    <p>
      He replied that he was so sensible of his situation that when he was
      reading Lucian's Dialogues of the Dead, among all the excuses which are
      alleged to Charon for not entering readily into his boat, he could not
      find one that fitted him. He had no house to finish; he had no daughter to
      provide for; he had no enemies upon whom he wished to revenge himself;
      "and I could not well," said he, "imagine what excuse I could make to
      Charon in order to obtain a little delay. I have done everything of
      consequence which I ever meant to do, and I could, at no time expect to
      leave my relations and friends in a better situation than that in which I
      am now likely to leave them; and I have, therefore, every reason to die
      contented."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Upon further consideration," said he, "I thought I might say to him,
      'Good Charon, I have been correcting my works for a new edition. Allow me
      a little time that I may see how the public receives the alterations.'
      'But,' Charon would answer, 'when you have seen the effect of this, you
      will be for making other alterations. There will be no end to such
      excuses; so, my honest friend, please step into the boat.' 'But,' I might
      still urge, 'have a little patience, good Charon; I have been endeavoring
      to open the eyes of the public; if I live a few years longer, I may have
      the satisfaction of seeing the downfall of some of the prevailing systems
      of superstition.' And Charon would then lose all temper and decency, and
      would cry out, 'You loitering rogue, that will not happen these many
      hundred years. Do you fancy I will grant you a lease for so long a time?
      Get into the boat this instant.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Comtesse de Boufflers, the dying man, with the perfect serenity
      that springs from an honest and loving life, writes:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I see death approach gradually without any anxiety or regret.... I salute
      you with great affection and regard, for the last time."
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 25th of August, 1776, the philosopher, the historian, the infidel,
      the honest man, and a benefactor of his race, in the composure born of a
      noble life, passed quietly and panglessly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Black wrote the following account of his death:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Monday, 26 August, 1776.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Dear Sir: Yesterday, about four o'clock in the afternoon, Mr. Hume
      expired. The near approach of his death became evident on the evening
      between Thursday and Friday, when his disease became exhaustive, and soon
      weakened him so much that he could no longer rise from his bed. He
      continued to the last perfectly sensible, and free from much pain or
      feeling of distress. He never dropped the smallest expression of
      impatience; but when he had occasion to speak to the people about him,
      always did it with affection and tenderness.... When he became very weak,
      it cost him an effort to speak, and he died in such happy composure of
      mind that nothing could exceed it."
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Cullen writes Dr. Hunter on the 17th of September, 1776, from which
      the following extracts are made:
    </p>
    <p>
      "You desire an account of Mr. Hume's last days, and I give it to you with
      great pleasure.... It was truly an example <i>des grands hommes qui sont
      morts en plaisantant</i>; and to me, who have been so often shocked with
      the horrors of superstition, the reflection on such a death is truly
      agreeable. For many weeks before his death he was very sensible of his
      gradual decay; and his answer to inquiries after his health was, several
      times, that he was going as fast as his enemies could wish, and as easily
      as his friends could desire. He passed most of the time in his
      drawing-room, admitting the visits of his friends, and with his usual
      spirit conversed with them upon literature and politics and whatever else
      was started. In conversation he seemed to be perfectly at ease; and to the
      last abounded with that pleasantry and those curious and entertaining
      anecdotes which ever distinguished him.... His senses and judgment did not
      fail him to the last hour of his life. He constantly discovered a strong
      sensibility of the attention and care of his friends; and midst great
      uneasiness and languor never betrayed any peevishness or impatience."
      (Here follows the conversation with Charon.) "These are a few particulars
      which may, perhaps, appear trivial; but to me, no particulars seem trivial
      which relate to so great a man. It is perhaps from trifles that we can
      best distinguish the tranquilness and cheerfulness of the philosopher at a
      time when the most part of mankind are under disquiet, and sometimes even
      horror. I consider the sacrifice of the cock as a more certain evidence of
      the tranquillity of Socrates than his discourse on immortality."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Christians took it for granted that this serene and placid man died
      filled with remorse for having given his real opinions, and proceeded to
      describe, with every incident and detail of horror, the terrors of his
      last moments. Brainless clergymen, incapable of understanding what Hume
      had written, knowing only in a general way that he had held their creeds
      in contempt, answered his arguments by maligning his character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christians took it for granted that he died in horror and recounted the
      terrible scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the facts of his death became generally known to intelligent men, the
      ministers redoubled their efforts to maintain the old calumnies, and most
      of them are in this employment even unto this day. Finding it impossible
      to tell enough falsehoods to hide the truth, a few of the more intelligent
      among the priests admitted that Hume not only died without showing any
      particular fear, but was guilty of unbecoming levity. The first charge was
      that he died like a coward; the next that he did not care enough, and went
      through the shadowy doors of the dread unknown with a smile upon his lips.
      The dying smile of David Hume scandalized the believers in a God of love.
      They felt shocked to see a man dying without fear who denied the miracles
      of the Bible; who had spent a life investigating the opinions of men; in
      endeavoring to prove to the world that the right way is the best way; that
      happiness is a real and substantial good, and that virtue is not a
      termagant with sunken cheeks and hollow eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christians hated to admit that a philosopher had died serenely without the
      aid of superstition&mdash;one who had taught that man could not make God
      happy by making himself miserable, and that a useful life, after all, was
      the best possible religion. They imagined that death would fill such a man
      with remorse and terror. He had never persecuted his fellow-men for the
      honor of God, and must needs die in despair. They were mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      He died as he had lived. Like a peaceful river with green and shaded banks
      he passed, without a murmur, into that waveless sea where life at last is
      rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      BENEDICT SPINOZA.
    </p>
    <p>
      ONE of the greatest thinkers was Benedict Spinoza, a Jew, born at
      Amsterdam, in 1632. He studied medicine and afterward theology. He
      endeavored to understand what he studied. In theology he necessarily
      failed. Theology is not intended to be understood,&mdash;it is only to be
      believed. It is an act, not of reason, but of faith. Spinoza put to the
      rabbis so many questions, and so persistently asked for reasons, that he
      became the most troublesome of students. When the rabbis found it
      impossible to answer the questions, they concluded to silence the
      questioner. He was tried, found guilty, and excommunicated from the
      synagogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the terrible curse of the Jewish religion, he was made an outcast from
      every Jewish home. His father could not give him shelter. His mother could
      not give him bread&mdash;could not speak to him, without becoming an
      outcast herself. All the cruelty of Jehovah, all the infamy of the Old
      Testament, was in this curse. In the darkness of the synagogue the rabbis
      lighted their torches, and while pronouncing the curse, extinguished them
      in blood, imploring God that in like manner the soul of Benedict Spinoza
      might be extinguished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spinoza was but twenty-four years old when he found himself without
      kindred, without friends, surrounded only by enemies. He uttered no
      complaint.
    </p>
    <p>
      He earned his bread with willing hands, and cheerfully divided his crust
      with those still poorer than himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tried to solve the problem of existence. To him, the universe was One.
      The Infinite embraced the All. The All was God. According to his belief,
      the universe did not commence to be. It is; from eternity it was; to
      eternity it will be.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was right. The universe is all there is, or was, or will be. It is both
      subject and object, contemplator and contemplated, creator and created,
      destroyer and destroyed, preserver and preserved, and hath within itself
      all causes, modes, motions and effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this there is hope. This is a foundation and a star. The Infinite is
      the All. Without the All, the Infinite cannot be. I am something. Without
      me, the Infinite cannot exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spinoza was a naturalist&mdash;that is to say, a pantheist. He took the
      ground that the supernatural is, and forever will be, an infinite
      impossibility. His propositions are luminous as stars, and each of his
      demonstrations is a Gibraltar, behind which logic sits and smiles at all
      the sophistries of superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spinoza has been hated because he has not been answered. He was a real
      republican. He regarded the people as the true and only source of
      political power. He put the state above the church, the people above the
      priest. He believed in the absolute liberty of worship, thought and
      speech. In every relation of life he was just, true, gentle, patient,
      modest and loving. He respected the rights of others, and endeavored to
      enjoy his own, and yet he brought upon himself the hatred of the Jewish
      and the Christian world. In his day, logic was blasphemy, and to think was
      the unpardonable sin. The priest hated the philosopher, revelation reviled
      reason, and faith was the sworn foe of every fact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spinoza was a philosopher, a philanthropist. He lived in a world of his
      own. He avoided men. His life was an intellectual solitude. He was a
      mental hermit. Only in his own brain he found the liberty he loved. And
      yet the rabbis and the priests, the ignorant zealot and the cruel bigot,
      feeling that this quiet, thoughtful, modest man was in some way forging
      weapons to be used against the church, hated him with all their hearts.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not retaliate. He found excuses for their acts. Their ignorance,
      their malice, their misguided and revengeful zeal excited only pity in his
      breast. He injured no man. He did not live on alms. He was poor&mdash;and
      yet, with the wealth of his brain, he enriched the world. On Sunday,
      February 21, 1677, Spinoza, one of the greatest and subtlest of
      metaphysicians&mdash;one of the noblest and purest of human beings,&mdash;at
      the age of forty-four, passed tranquilly away; and notwithstanding the
      curse of the synagogue under which he had lived and most lovingly labored,
      death left upon his lips the smile of perfect peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      OUR INFIDELS.
    </p>
    <p>
      IN our country there were three infidels&mdash;Paine, Franklin and
      Jefferson. The colonies were filled with superstition, the Puritans with
      the spirit of persecution. Laws savage, ignorant and malignant had been
      passed in every colony, for the purpose of destroying intellectual
      liberty. Mental freedom was absolutely unknown. The Toleration Acts of
      Maryland tolerated only Christians&mdash;not infidels, not thinkers, not
      investigators. The charity of Roger Williams was not extended to those who
      denied the Bible, or suspected the divinity of Christ. It was not based
      upon the rights of man, but upon the rights of believers, who differed in
      non-essential points.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment the colonies began to deny the rights of the king they
      suspected the power of the priest. In digging down to find an excuse for
      fighting George the Third, they unwittingly undermined the church. They
      went through the Revolution together. They found that all denominations
      fought equally well. They also found that persons without religion had
      patriotism and courage, and were willing to die that a new nation might be
      born. As a matter of fact the pulpit was not in hearty sympathy with our
      fathers. Many priests were imprisoned because they would not pray for the
      Continental Congress. After victory had enriched our standard, and it
      became necessary to make a constitution&mdash;to establish a government&mdash;the
      infidels&mdash;the men like Paine, like Jefferson, and like Franklin, saw
      that the church must be left out; that a government deriving its just
      powers from the consent of the governed could make no contract with a
      church pretending to derive its powers from an infinite God.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the efforts of these infidels, the name of God was left out of the
      Constitution of the United States. They knew that if an infinite being was
      put in, no room would be left for the people. They knew that if any church
      was made the mistress of the state, that mistress, like all others, would
      corrupt, weaken, and destroy. Washington wished a church established by
      law in Virginia. He was prevented by Thomas Jefferson. It was only a
      little while ago that people were compelled to attend church by law in the
      Eastern States, and taxes were raised for the support of churches the same
      as for the construction of highways and bridges. The great principle
      enunciated in the Constitution has silently repealed most of these laws.
      In the presence of this great instrument, the constitutions of the States
      grew small and mean, and in a few years every law that puts a chain upon
      the mind, except in Delaware, will be repealed, and for these our children
      may thank the Infidels of 1776.
    </p>
    <p>
      The church never has pretended that Jefferson or Franklin died in fear.
      Franklin wrote no books against the fables of the ancient Jews. He thought
      it useless to cast the pearls of thought before the swine of ignorance and
      fear. Jefferson was a statesman. He was the father of a great party. He
      gave his views in letters and to trusted friends. He was a Virginian,
      author of the Declaration of Independence, founder of a university, father
      of a political party, President of the United States, a statesman and
      philosopher. He was too powerful for the divided churches of his day.
      Paine was a foreigner, a citizen of the world. He had attacked Washington
      and the Bible. He had done these things openly, and what he had said could
      not be answered. His arguments were so good that his character was bad.
    </p>
    <p>
      THOMAS PAINE
    </p>
    <p>
      THOMAS PAINE was born in Thetford, England. He came from the common
      people. At the age of thirty-seven he left England for America. He was the
      first to perceive the destiny of the New World. He wrote the pamphlet
      "Common Sense," and in a few months the Continental Congress declared the
      colonies free and independent States&mdash;a new nation was born. Paine
      having aroused the spirit of independence, gave every energy of his soul
      to keep the spirit alive. He was with the army. He shared its defeats and
      its glory. When the situation became desperate, he gave them "The Crisis."
      It was a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night, leading the way to
      freedom, honor, and to victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The writings of Paine are gemmed with compact statements that carry
      conviction to the dullest. Day and night he labored for America, until
      there was a government of the people and for the people. At the close of
      the Revolution, no one stood higher than Thomas Paine. Had he been willing
      to live a hypocrite, he would have been respectable, he at least could
      have died surrounded by other hypocrites, and at his death there would
      have been an imposing funeral, with miles of carriages, filled with
      hypocrites, and above his hypocritical dust there would have been a
      hypocritical monument covered with lies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having done so much for man in America, he went to France. The seeds sown
      by the great infidels were bearing fruit in Europe. The eighteenth century
      was crowning its gray hairs with the wreath of progress. Upon his arrival
      in France he was elected a member of the French Convention&mdash;in fact,
      he was selected about the same time by the people of no less than four
      Departments. He was one of the committee to draft a constitution for
      France. In the Assembly, where nearly all were demanding the execution of
      the king, he had the courage to vote against death. To vote against the
      death of the king was to vote against his own life. This was the sublimity
      of devotion to principle. For this he was arrested, imprisoned, and doomed
      to death. While under sentence of death, while in the gloomy cell of his
      prison, Thomas Paine wrote to Washington, asking him to say one word to
      Robespierre in favor of the author of "Common Sense." Washington did not
      reply. He wrote again. Washington, the President, paid no attention to
      Thomas Paine, the prisoner. The letter was thrown into the wastebasket of
      forgetfulness, and Thomas Paine remained condemned to death. Afterward he
      gave his opinion of Washington at length, and I must say, that I have
      never found it in my heart to greatly blame him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Paine, having done so much for political liberty, turned his
      attention to the superstitions of his age. He published "The Age of
      Reason;" and from that day to this, his character has been maligned by
      almost every priest in Christendom. He has been held up as the terrible
      example. Every man who has expressed an honest thought, has been warningly
      referred to Thomas Paine. All his services were forgotten. No kind word
      fell from any pulpit. His devotion to principle, his zeal for human
      rights, were no longer remembered. Paine simply took the ground that it is
      a contradiction to call a thing a revelation that comes to us second-hand.
      There can be no revelation beyond the first communication. All after that
      is hearsay. He also showed that the prophecies of the Old Testament had no
      relation whatever to Jesus Christ, and contended that Jesus Christ was
      simply a man. In other words, Paine was an enlightened Unitarian. Paine
      thought the Old Testament too barbarous to have been the work of an
      infinitely benevolent God. He attacked the doctrine that salvation depends
      upon belief. He insisted that every man has the right to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the publication of these views every falsehood that malignity could
      coin and malice pass was given to the world. On his return to America,
      after the election to the presidency of another infidel, Thomas Jefferson,
      it was not safe for him to appear in the public streets. He was in danger
      of being mobbed. Under the very flag he had helped to put in heaven his
      rights were not respected. Under the Constitution that he had suggested,
      his life was insecure. He had helped to give liberty to more than three
      millions of his fellow-citizens, and they were willing to deny it unto
      him. He was deserted, ostracized, shunned, maligned, and cursed. He
      enjoyed the seclusion of a leper; but he maintained through it all his
      integrity. He stood by the convictions of his mind. Never for one moment
      did he hesitate or waver.
    </p>
    <p>
      He died almost alone. The moment he died Christians commenced
      manufacturing horrors for his death-bed. They had his chamber filled with
      devils rattling chains, and these ancient lies are annually certified to
      by the respectable Christians of the present day. The truth is, he died as
      he had lived. Some ministers were impolite enough to visit him against his
      will. Several of them he ordered from his room. A couple of Catholic
      priests, in all the meekness of hypocrisy, called that they might enjoy
      the agonies of a dying friend of man. Thomas Paine, rising in his bed, the
      few embers of expiring life blown into flame by the breath of indignation,
      had the goodness to curse them both. His physician, who seems to have been
      a meddling fool, just as the cold hand of death was touching the patriot's
      heart, whispered in the dull ear of the dying man: "Do you believe, or do
      you wish to believe, that Jesus Christ is the son of God?" And the reply
      was: "I have no wish to believe on that subject."
    </p>
    <p>
      These were the last remembered words of Thomas Paine. He died as serenely
      as ever Christian passed away. He died in the full possession of his mind,
      and on the very brink and edge of death proclaimed the doctrines of his
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every Christian, every philanthropist, every believer in human liberty,
      should feel under obligation to Thomas Paine for the splendid service
      rendered by him in the darkest days of the American Revolution. In the
      midnight of Valley Forge, "The Crisis" was the first star that glittered
      in the wide horizon of despair. Every good man should remember with
      gratitude the brave words spoken by Thomas Paine in the French Convention
      against the death of Louis. He said: "We will kill the king, but not the
      man. We will destroy monarchy, not the monarch."
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Paine was a champion, in both hemispheres, of human liberty; one of
      the founders and fathers of this Republic; one of the foremost men of his
      age. He never wrote a word in favor of injustice. He was a despiser of
      slavery. He abhorred tyranny in every form. He was, in the widest and best
      sense, a friend of all his race. His head was as clear as his heart was
      good, and he had the courage to speak his honest thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was the first man to write these words: "The United States of America."
      He proposed the present Federal Constitution. He furnished every thought
      that now glitters in the Declaration of Independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He believed in one God and no more. He was a believer even in special
      providence, and he hoped for immortality.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can the world abhor the man who said:
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe in the equality of man, and that religious duties consist in
      doing justice, in loving mercy, and endeavoring to make our
      fellow-creatures happy."&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "It is necessary to the happiness of man that he be mentally faithful to
      himself."&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "The word of God is the creation which we behold."&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Belief in a cruel God makes a cruel man."&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "My opinion is, that those whose lives have been spent in doing good and
      endeavoring to make their fellow-mortals happy, will be happy hereafter."&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "One good schoolmaster is of more use than a hundred priests."&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "I believe in one God, and no more, and I hope for happiness beyond this
      life."&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "Man has no property in man"&mdash;and "The key of heaven is not in the
      keeping of any sect!"
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it not been for Thomas Paine I could not deliver this lecture here
      to-night..
    </p>
    <p>
      It is still fashionable to calumniate this man&mdash;and yet Channing,
      Theodore Parker, Longfellow, Emerson, and in fact all the liberal
      Unitarians and Universalists of the world have adopted the opinions of
      Thomas Paine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us compare these Infidels with the Christians of their time:
    </p>
    <p>
      Compare Julian with Constantine,&mdash;the murderer of his wife,&mdash;the
      murderer of his son,&mdash;and who established Christianity with the same
      sword he had wet with their blood. Compare him with all the Christian
      emperors&mdash;with all the robbers and murderers and thieves&mdash;the
      parricides and fratricides and matricides that ever wore the imperial
      purple on the banks of the Tiber or the shores of the Bosphorus.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us compare Bruno with the Christians who burned him; and we will
      compare Spinoza, Voltaire, Diderot, Hume, Jefferson, Paine&mdash;with the
      men who it is claimed have been the visible representatives of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it be remembered that the popes have committed every crime of which
      human nature is capable, and that not one of them was the friend of
      intellectual liberty&mdash;that not one of them ever shed one ray of
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us compare these Infidels with the founders of sectarian churches; you
      will see how narrow, how bigoted, how cruel were their founders, and how
      broad, how generous, how noble, were these infidels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us be honest. The great effort of the human mind is to ascertain the
      order of facts by which we are surrounded&mdash;the history of things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who has accomplished the most in this direction&mdash;the church, or the
      unbelievers? Upon one side write all that the church has discovered&mdash;every
      phenomenon that has been explained by a creed, every new fact in Nature
      that has been discovered by a church, and on the other side write the
      discoveries of Humboldt, and the observations and demonstrations of
      Darwin!
    </p>
    <p>
      Who has made Germany famous&mdash;her priests, or her scientists?
    </p>
    <p>
      Goethe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kant: That immortal man who said: "Whoever thinks that he can please God
      in any way except by discharging his obligations to his fellows, is
      superstitious."
    </p>
    <p>
      And that greatest and bravest of thinkers, Ernst
    </p>
    <p>
      Haeckel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humboldt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Italy:&mdash;Mazzini. Garibaldi.
    </p>
    <p>
      In France who are and were the friends of freedom&mdash;the Catholic
      priests, or Renan? the bishops, or Gambetta?&mdash;Dupanloup, or Victor
      Hugo?
    </p>
    <p>
      Michelet&mdash;Taine&mdash;Auguste Comte.
    </p>
    <p>
      England:&mdash;Let us compare her priests with John Stuart Mill,&mdash;Harriet
      Martineau, that "free rover on the breezy common of the universe."&mdash;George
      Eliot&mdash;with Huxley and Tyndall, with Holyoake and Harrison&mdash;and
      above and over all&mdash;with Charles Darwin.

    <h2>
      CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p>
      LET us be honest. Did all the priests of Rome increase the mental wealth
      of man as much as Bruno? Did all the priests of France do as great a work
      for the civilization of the world as Diderot and Voltaire? Did all the
      ministers of Scotland add as much to the sum of human knowledge as David
      Hume? Have all the clergymen, monks, friars, ministers, priests, bishops,
      cardinals and popes, from the day of Pentecost to the last election, done
      as much for human liberty as Thomas Paine?&mdash;as much for science as
      Charles Darwin?
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the world be if infidels had never been?
    </p>
    <p>
      The infidels have been the brave and thoughtful men; the flower of all the
      world; the pioneers and heralds of the blessed day of liberty and love;
      the generous spirits of the unworthy past; the seers and prophets of our
      race; the great chivalric souls, proud victors on the battlefields of
      thought, the creditors of all the years to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should it be taken for granted that the men who devoted their lives to
      the liberation of their fellow-men should have been hissed at in the hour
      of death by the snakes of conscience, while men who defended slavery,
      practiced polygamy, justified the stealing of babes from the breasts of
      mothers, and lashed the naked back of unpaid labor are supposed to have
      passed smilingly from earth to the embraces of the angels? Why should we
      think that the brave thinkers, the investigators, the honest men, must
      have left the crumbling shore of time in dread and fear, while the
      instigators of the massacre of St. Bartholomew; the inventors and users of
      thumbscrews, of iron boots and racks; the burners and tearers of human
      flesh; the stealers, the whippers and the enslavers of men; the buyers and
      beaters of maidens, mothers, and babes; the founders of the Inquisition;
      the makers of chains; the builders of dungeons; the calumniators of the
      living; the slanderers of the dead, and even the murderers of Jesus
      Christ, all died in the odor of sanctity, with white, forgiven hands
      folded upon the breasts of peace, while the destroyers of prejudice, the
      apostles of humanity, the soldiers of liberty, the breakers of fetters,
      the creators of light, died surrounded by the fierce fiends of God?

    <h2>
      WHICH WAY?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      I.
    </h3>
    <p>
      THERE are two ways,&mdash;the natural and the supernatural.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way is to live for the world we are in, to develop the brain by study
      and investigation, to take, by invention, advantage of the forces of
      nature, to the end that we may have good houses, raiment and food, to the
      end that the hunger of the mind may be fed through art and science.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other way is to live for another world that we expect, to sacrifice
      this life that we have for another that we know not of. The other way is
      by prayer and ceremony to obtain the assistance, the protection of some
      phantom above the clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way is to think&mdash;to investigate, to observe, and follow the light
      of reason. The other way is to believe, to accept, to follow, to deny the
      authority of your own senses, your own reason, and bow down to those who
      are impudent enough to declare that they know.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way is to live for the benefit of your fellow-men&mdash;for your wife
      and children&mdash;to make those you love happy and to shield them from
      the sorrows of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other way is to live for ghosts, goblins, phantoms and gods with the
      hope that they will reward you in another world.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way is to enthrone reason and rely on facts, the other to crown
      credulity and live on faith.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way is to walk by the light within&mdash;by the flame that illumines
      the brain, verifying all by the senses&mdash;by touch and sight and sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other way is to extinguish the sacred light and follow blindly the
      steps of another.
    </p>
    <p>
      One way is to be an honest man, giving to others your thought, standing
      erect, intrepid, careless of phantoms and hells.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other way is to cringe and crawl, to betray your nobler self, and to
      deprive others of the liberty that you have not the courage to enjoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do not imagine that I hate the ones who have taken the wrong side and
      traveled the wrong road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our fathers did the best they could. They believed in the Supernatural,
      and they thought that sacrifices and prayer, fasting and weeping, would
      induce the Supernatural to give them sunshine, rain and harvest&mdash;long
      life in this world and eternal joy in another. To them, God was an
      absolute monarch, quick to take offence, sudden in anger, terrible in
      punishment, jealous, hateful to his enemies, generous to his favorites.
      They believed also in the existence of an evil God, almost the equal of
      the other God in strength, and a little superior in cunning. Between these
      two Gods was the soul of man like a mouse between two paws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Both of these Gods inspired fear. Our fathers did not quite love God, nor
      quite hate the Devil, but they were afraid of both. They really wished to
      enjoy themselves with God in the next world and with the Devil in this.
      They believed that the course of Nature was affected by their conduct;
      that floods and storms, diseases, earthquakes and tempests were sent as
      punishments, and that all good phenomena were rewards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything was under the direction and control of supernatural powers. The
      air, the darkness, were filled with angels and devils; witches and wizards
      planned and plotted against the pious&mdash;against the true believers.
      Eclipses were produced by the sins of the people, and the unusual was
      regarded as the miraculous. In the good old times Christendom was an
      insane asylum, and insane priests and prelates were the keepers. There was
      no science. The people did not investigate&mdash;did not think. They
      trembled and believed. Ignorance and superstition ruled the Christian
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last a few began to observe, to make records, and to think.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was found that eclipses came at certain intervals, and that their
      coming could be foretold. This demonstrated that the actions of men had
      nothing to do with eclipses. A few began to suspect that earthquakes and
      storms had natural causes, and happened without the slightest reference to
      mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some began to doubt the existence of evil spirits, or the interference of
      good ones in the affairs of the world. Finding out something about
      astronomy, the great number of the stars, the certain and continuous
      motions of the planets, and the fact that many of them were vastly larger
      than the earth; ascertaining something about the earth, the slow
      development of forms, the growth and distribution of plants, the formation
      of islands and continents, the parts played by fire, water and air through
      countless centuries; the kinship of all life; fixing the earth's place in
      the constellation of the sun; by experiment and research discovering a few
      secrets of chemistry; by the invention of printing, and the preservation
      and dissemination of facts, theories and thoughts, they were enabled to
      break a few chains of superstition, to free themselves a little from the
      dominion of the supernatural, and to set their faces toward the light.
      Slowly the number of investigators and thinkers increased, slowly the real
      facts were gathered, the sciences began to appear, the old beliefs grew a
      little absurd, the supernatural retreated and ceased to interfere in the
      ordinary affairs of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Schools were founded, children were taught, books were printed and the
      thinkers increased. Day by day confidence lessened in the supernatural,
      and day by day men were more and more impressed with the idea that man
      must be his own protector, his own providence. From the mists and darkness
      of savagery and superstition emerged the dawn of the Natural. A sense of
      freedom took possession of the mind, and the soul began to dream of its
      power. On every side were invention and discovery, and bolder thought. The
      church began to regard the friends of science as its foes: Theologians
      resorted to chain and fagot&mdash;to mutilation and torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thinkers were denounced as heretics and Atheists&mdash;as the minions
      of Satan and the defamers of Christ. All the ignorance, prejudice and
      malice of superstition were aroused and all united for the destruction of
      investigation and thought. For centuries this conflict was waged. Every
      outrage was perpetrated, every crime committed by the believers in the
      supernatural. But, in spite of all, the disciples of the Natural
      increased, and the power of the church waned. Now the intelligence of the
      world is on the side of the Natural. Still the conflict goes on&mdash;the
      supernatural constantly losing, and the Natural constantly gaining. In a
      few years the victory of science over superstition will be complete and
      universal.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, there have been for many centuries two philosophies of life; one in
      favor of the destruction of the passions&mdash;the lessening of wants,&mdash;and
      absolute reliance on some higher power; the other, in favor of the
      reasonable gratification of the passions, the increase of wants, and their
      supply by industry, ingenuity and invention, and the reliance of man on
      his own efforts. Diogenes, Epictetus, Socrates to some extent, Buddha and
      Christ, all taught the first philosophy. All despised riches and luxury,
      all were the enemies of art and music, the despisers of good clothes and
      good food and good homes. They were the philosophers of poverty and rags,
      of huts and hovels, of ignorance and faith. They preached the glories of
      another world and the miseries of this. They derided the prosperous, the
      industrious, those who enjoyed life, and reserved heaven for beggars.
    </p>
    <p>
      This philosophy is losing authority, and now most people are anxious to be
      happy here in this life. Most people want food and roof and raiment&mdash;books
      and pictures, luxury and leisure. They believe in developing the brain&mdash;in
      making servants and slaves of the forces of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the intelligent men of the world have cast aside the teachings, the
      philosophy of the ascetics. They no longer believe in the virtue of
      fasting and self-torture. They believe that happiness is the only good,
      and that the time to be happy is now&mdash;here, in this world. They no
      longer believe in the rewards and punishments of the supernatural. They
      believe in consequences, and that the consequences of bad actions are
      evil, and the consequences of good actions are good.
    </p>
    <p>
      They believe that man by investigation, by reason, should find out the
      conditions of happiness, and then live and act in accordance with such
      conditions. They do not believe that earthquakes, or tempests, or
      volcanoes, or eclipses are caused by the conduct of men. They no longer
      believe in the supernatural. They do not regard themselves as the serfs,
      servants, or favorites of any celestial king. They feel that many evils
      can be avoided by knowledge, and for that reason they believe in the
      development of the brain. The schoolhouse is their church and the
      university their cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, there have been for some centuries two theories of government,&mdash;one
      theological, the other secular.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king received his power directly from God. It was the business of the
      people to obey. The priests received their creeds from God and it was the
      duty of the people to believe.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theological government is growing somewhat unpopular. In England,
      Parliament has taken the place of God, and in the United States,
      government derives its powers from the consent of the governed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Probably Emperor William is the only man in Germany who really believes
      that God placed him on the throne and will keep him there whether the
      German people are satisfied or not. Italy has retired the Catholic God
      from politics, France belongs to and is governed by the French, and even
      in Russia there are millions who hold the Czar and all his divine
      pretensions in contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theological governments are passing away and the secular are slowly
      taking their places. Man is growing greater and the Gods are becoming
      vague and indistinct. These "divine" governments rest on the fear and
      ignorance of the many, the cunning, the impudence and the mendacity of the
      few. A secular government is born of the intelligence, the honesty and the
      courage, not only of the few, but of the many.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have found that man can govern himself without the assistance of priest
      or pope, of ghost or God. We have found that religion is not self-evident,
      and that to believe without evidence is not a praiseworthy action. We know
      that the self-evident is the square and compass of the brain, the polar
      star in the firmament of mind. And we know that no one denies the
      self-evident. We also know that there is no particular goodness in
      believing when the evidence is sufficient, and certainly there is' none in
      saying; that you believe when the evidence is insufficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      The believers have not all been good. Some of the worst people in the
      whole world have been believers. The gentlemen who made Socrates drink
      hemlock were believers. The Jews who crucified Christ were believers in
      and worshipers of God. The devil believes in the Trinity, the Father, Son
      and Holy Ghost, and yet it does not seem to have affected his moral
      character. According to the Bible, he trembles, but he does not reform. At
      last we have concluded that we have a right to examine the religion of our
      fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      II.
    </p>
    <p>
      ALL Christians know that all the gods, except Jehovah, were created by
      man; that they were, and are, false, foolish and monstrous; that all the
      heathen temples were built and all their altars erected in vain; that the
      sacrifices were wasted, that the priests were hypocrites, that their
      prayers were unanswered and that the poor people were deceived, robbed and
      enslaved. But after all, is our God superior to the gods of the heathen?
    </p>
    <p>
      We can ask this question now because we are prosperous, and prosperity
      gives courage. If we should have a few earthquakes or a pestilence we
      might fall on our knees, shut our eyes and ask the forgiveness of God for
      ever having had a thought. We know that famine is the friend of faith and
      that calamity is the sunshine of superstition. But as we have no
      pestilence or famine, and as the crust of the earth is reasonably quiet,
      we can afford to examine into the real character of our God.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must be admitted that the use of power is an excellent test of
      character.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would a good God appeal to prejudice, the armor, fortress, sword and
      shield of ignorance? to credulity, the ring in the priest-led nose of
      stupidity? to fear, the capital stock of imposture, the lever of
      hypocrisy? Would a good God frighten or enlighten his children? Would a
      good God appeal to reason or ignorance, to justice or selfishness, to
      liberty or the lash?
    </p>
    <p>
      To our first parents in the Garden of Eden, our God said nothing about the
      sacredness of love, nothing about children, nothing about education, about
      justice or liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      After they had violated his command he became ferocious as a wild beast.
      He cursed the earth and to Eve he said:&mdash;"I will greatly multiply thy
      sorrow. In sorrow shalt thou bring forth children. Thy husband shall rule
      over thee."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our God made love the slave of pain, made wives serfs, and brutalized the
      firesides of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our God drowned the whole world, with the exception of eight people; made
      the earth one vast and shoreless sea covered with corpses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did he cover the world with men, women and children knowing that he
      would destroy them?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did he not try to reform them? Why would he create people, knowing
      that they could not be reformed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it possible that our God was intelligent and good?
    </p>
    <p>
      After the flood our God selected the Jews and abandoned the rest of his
      children. He paid no attention to the Hindoos, neglected the Egyptians,
      ignored the Persians, forgot the Assyrians and failed to remember the
      Greeks. And yet he was the father of them all. For many centuries he was
      only a tribal God, protecting the few and despising the many. Our God was
      ignorant, knew nothing of astronomy or geology. He did not even know the
      shape of the earth, and thought the stars were only specks.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew nothing of disease. He thought that the blood of a bird that had
      been killed over running water was good medicine. He was revengeful and
      cruel, and assisted some of his children to butcher and destroy others. He
      commanded them to murder men, wives and children, and to keep alive the
      maidens and distribute them among his soldiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our God established slavery&mdash;commanded men to buy their fellow-men,
      to make merchandise of wives and babes. Our God sanctioned polygamy and
      made wives the property of their husbands. Our God murdered the people for
      the crimes of kings.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man of intelligence, no one whose brain has not been poisoned by
      superstition, paralyzed by fear, can read the Old Testament without being
      forced to the conclusion that our God was, a wild beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      If we must have a god, let him be merciful. Let us remember that "the
      quality of mercy is not strained." Let us remember that when the sword of
      Justice becomes a staff to support the weak, it bursts into blossom, and
      that the perfume of that flower is the only incense, the only offering,
      the only sacrifice that mercy will accept.
    </p>
    <p>
      III.
    </p>
    <p>
      SO, there have been two theories about the cause and cure of disease. One
      is the theological, the other the scientific.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the theological idea, diseases were produced by evil spirits,
      by devils who entered into the bodies of people.
    </p>
    <p>
      These devils could be cast out by prophets, inspired men and priests.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Christ was upon earth his principal business was to cast out evil
      spirits.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many centuries the priests followed his example, and during the Middle
      Ages millions of devils were driven from the bodies of men. Diseases were
      cured with little images of consecrated pewter, with pieces of paper, with
      crosses worn about the neck&mdash;by having plaster of Paris Virgins and
      clay Christs at the head of the bed, by touching the bones of dead saints,
      or pieces of the true cross, or one of the nails that was driven through
      the flesh of Christ, or a garment that had been worn by the Virgin Mary,
      or by sprinkling the breast with holy water, or saying prayers, or
      counting beads, or making the stations of the cross, or by going without
      meat, or wearing haircloth, or in some way torturing the body. All
      diseases were supposed to be of supernatural origin and all cures were of
      the same nature. Pestilences were stopped by processions, led by priests
      carrying the Host.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was known of natural causes and effects. Everything was miraculous
      and mysterious. The priests were cunning and the people credulous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Slowly another theory as to the cause and cure of disease took possession
      of the mind. A few discarded the idea of devils, and took the ground that
      diseases were naturally produced, and that many of them could be cured by
      natural means.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first the physician was exceedingly ignorant, but he knew more than the
      priest. Slowly but surely he pushed the priest from the bedside. Some
      people finally became intelligent enough to trust their bodies to the
      doctors, and remained ignorant enough to leave the care of their souls
      with the priests. Among civilized people the theological theory has been
      cast aside, and the miraculous, the supernatural, no longer has a place in
      medicine. In Catholic countries the peasants are still cured by images,
      prayers, holy water and the bones of saints, but when the priests are sick
      they send for a physician, and now even the Pope, God's agent, gives his
      sacred body to the care of a doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scientific has triumphed to a great extent over the theological.
    </p>
    <p>
      No intelligent person now believes that devils inhabit the bodies of men.
      No intelligent person now believes that devils are trying to control the
      actions of men. No intelligent person now believes that devils exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet, at the present time, in the city of New York, Catholic priests
      are exhibiting a piece of one of the bones of Saint Anne, the supposed
      mother of the Virgin Mary. Some of these priests may be credulous
      imbeciles and some may be pious rogues. If they have any real intelligence
      they must know that there is no possible way of proving that the piece of
      bone ever belonged to Saint Anne. And if they have any real intelligence
      they must know that even the bones of Saint Anne were substantially like
      the bones of other people, made of substantially the same material, and
      that the medical and miraculous qualities of all human bones must be
      substantially the same. And yet these priests are obtaining from their
      credulous dupes thousands and thousands of dollars for the privilege of
      seeing this bone and kissing the box that contains the "sacred relic."
    </p>
    <p>
      Archbishop Corrigan knows that no one knows who the mother of the Virgin
      Mary was, that no one knows about any of the bones of this unknown mother,
      knows that the whole thing is a theological fraud, knows that his priests,
      or priests under his jurisdiction, are obtaining money under false
      pretences. Cardinal Gibbons knows the same, but neither of these pious
      gentlemen has one word to say against this shameless crime. They are
      willing that priests for the benefit of the church should make merchandise
      of the hopes and fears of ignorant believers; willing that fraud that
      produces revenue should live and thrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the honesty of the theologian. If these gentlemen should be taken
      sick they would not touch the relic. They would send for a physician.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me tell you a Japanese story that is exactly in point:
    </p>
    <p>
      An old monk was in charge of a monastery that had been built above the
      bones of a saint. These bones had the power to cure diseases and they were
      so placed that by thrusting the arm through an orifice they could be
      touched by the hand of the pilgrim. Many people, afflicted in many ways,
      came and touched these bones. Many thought they had been benefited or
      cured, and many in gratitude left large sums of money with the monk. One
      day the old monk addressed his assistant as follows: "My dear son,
      business has fallen off, and I can easily attend to all who come. You will
      have to find another place. I will give you the white donkey, a little
      money, and my blessing."
    </p>
    <p>
      So the young man mounted upon the beast and went his way. In a few days
      his money was gone and the white donkey died. An idea took possession of
      the young man's mind. By the side of the road he buried the donkey, and
      then to every passer-by held out his hands and said in solemn tones: "I
      pray thee give me a little money to build a temple above the bones of the
      sinless one."
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was his success that he built the temple, and then thousands came to
      touch the bones of the sinless one. The young man became rich, gave
      employment to many assistants and lived in the greatest luxury.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day he made up his mind to visit his old master. Taking with him a
      large retinue of servants he started for the old home. When he reached the
      place the old monk was seated by the doorway. With great astonishment he
      looked at the young man and his retinue. The young man dismounted and made
      himself known, and the old monk cried: "Where hast thou been? Tell me, I
      pray thee, the story of thy success."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Ah," the young man replied, "old age is stupid, but youth has thoughts.
      Wait until we are alone and I will tell you all."
    </p>
    <p>
      So that night the young man told his story, told about the death and
      burial of the donkey, the begging of money to build a temple over the
      bones of the sinless one, and of the sums of money he had received for the
      cures the bones had wrought.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he finished a satisfied smile crept over his pious face as he added:
      "Old age is stupid, but youth has thoughts."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Be not so fast," said the old monk, as he placed his trembling hand on
      the head of his visitor, "Young man, this monastery in which your youth
      was passed, in which you have seen so many miracles performed, so many
      diseases cured, was built above the sacred bones of the mother of your
      little jackass."
    </p>
    <p>
      IV.
    </p>
    <p>
      THERE are two ways of accounting for the sacred books and religions of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      One is to say that the sacred books were written by inspired men, and that
      our religion was revealed to us by God.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other is to say that all books have been written by men, without any
      aid from supernatural powers, and that all religions have been naturally
      produced.
    </p>
    <p>
      We find that other races and peoples have sacred books and prophets,
      priests and Christs; we find too that their sacred books were written by
      men who had the prejudices and peculiarities of the race to which they
      belonged, and that they contain the mistakes and absurdities peculiar to
      the people who produced them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christians are perfectly satisfied that all the so-called sacred books,
      with the exception of the Old and New Testaments, were written by men, and
      that the claim of inspiration is perfectly absurd. So they believe that
      all religions, except Judaism and Christianity, were invented by men. The
      believers in other religions take the ground that their religion was
      revealed by God, and that all others, including Judaism and Christianity,
      were made by men. All are right and all are wrong. When they say that
      "other" religions were produced by men, they are right; when they say that
      their religion was revealed by God, they are wrong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we know that all tribes and nations have had some kind of religion;
      that they have believed in the existence of good and evil beings, spirits
      or powers, that could be softened by gifts or prayer. Now we know that at
      the foundation of every religion, of all worship, is the pale and
      bloodless face of fear. Now we know that all religions and all sacred
      books have been naturally produced&mdash;all born of ignorance, fear and
      cunning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now we know that the gifts, sacrifices and prayers were all in vain; that
      no god received and that no god heard or answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few years ago prayers decided the issue of battle, and priests, through
      their influence with God, could give the victory. Now no intelligent man
      expects any answer to prayer. He knows that nature pursues her course
      without reference to the wishes of men, that the clouds float, the winds
      blow, the rain falls and the sun shines without regard to the human race.
      Yet millions are still praying, still hoping that they can gain the
      protection of some god, that some being will guard them from accident and
      disease. Year after year the ministers make the same petitions, pray for
      the same things, and keep on in spite of the fact that nothing is
      accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever good men do some noble thing the clergy give their God the
      credit, and when evil things are done they hold the men who did the evil
      responsible, and forget to blame their God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Praying has become a business, a profession, a trade, A minister is never
      happier than when praying in public. Most of them are exceedingly familiar
      with their God. Knowing that he knows everything, they tell him the needs
      of the nation and the desires of the people, they advise him what to do
      and when to do it. They appeal to his pride, asking him to do certain
      things for his own glory. They often pray for the impossible. In the House
      of Representatives in Washington I once heard a chaplain pray for what he
      must have known was impossible. Without a change of countenance, without a
      smile, with a face solemn as a sepulchre, he said: "I pray thee, O God, to
      give Congress wisdom." It may be that ministers really think that their
      prayers do good and it may be that frogs imagine that their croaking
      brings spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men of thought now know that all religions and all sacred books have
      been made by men; that no revelation has come from any being superior to
      nature; that all the prophecies were either false or made after the event;
      that no miracle ever was or ever will be performed; that no God wants the
      worship or the assistance of man; that no-prayer has ever coaxed one drop
      of rain from the sky, one ray of light from the sun; that no prayer has
      stayed the flood, or the tides of the sea, or folded the wings of the
      storm; that no prayer has given water to the cracked and bleeding lips of
      thirst, or food to the famishing; that no prayer has stopped the
      pestilence, stilled the earthquake or quieted the volcano; that no prayer
      has shielded the innocent, succored the oppressed, unlocked the dungeon's
      door, broke the chains of slaves, rescued the good and noble from the
      scaffold, or extinguished the fagot's flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intelligent man now knows that we live in a natural world, that gods
      and devils and the sons of God are all phantoms, that our religion and our
      Deity are much like the religion and deities of other nations, and that
      the stone god of a savage answers prayer and protects his worshipers
      precisely the same, and to just the same extent, as the Father, Son and
      Holy Ghost.
    </p>
    <p>
      V.
    </p>
    <p>
      THERE are two theories about morals. One theory is that the moral man
      obeys the commands of a supposed God, without stopping to think whether
      the commands are right or wrong. He believes that the will of the God is
      the source and fountain of right. He thinks a thing is wrong because the
      God prohibits it, not that the God prohibits it because it is wrong. This
      theory calls not for thought, but for obedience. It does not appeal to
      reason, but to the fear of punishment, the hope of reward. God is a king
      whose will is law, and men are serfs and slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many contend that without a belief in the existence of God morality is
      impossible and that virtue would perish from the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      This absurd theory, with its "Thus saith the Lord" has been claimed to be
      independent of and superior to reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      The other theory is that right and wrong exist in the nature of things;
      that certain actions preserve or increase the happiness of man, and that
      other actions cause sorrow and misery; that all those actions that cause
      happiness are moral, and that all others are evil, or indifferent. Right
      and wrong are not revelations from some supposed god, but have been
      discovered through the experience and intelligence of man. There is
      nothing miraculous or supernatural about morality. Neither has morality
      anything to do with another world, or with an infinite being. It applies
      to conduct here, and the effect of that conduct on ourselves and others
      determines its nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this world people are obliged to supply their wants by labor. Industry
      is a necessity, and those who work are the natural enemies of those who
      steal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It required no revelation from God to make larceny unpopular. Human beings
      naturally object to being injured, maimed, or killed, and so everywhere,
      and at all times, they have tried to protect themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men did not require a revelation from God to put in their minds the
      thought of self-preservation. To defend yourself when attacked is as
      natural as to eat when you are hungry.
    </p>
    <p>
      To determine the quality of an action by showing that it is in accordance
      with, or contrary to the command of some supposed God, is superstition
      pure and simple. To test all actions by their consequences is scientific
      and in accord with reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the supernatural theory, natural consequences are not taken
      into consideration. Actions are wrong because they have been prohibited
      and right because they have been commanded. According to the Catholic
      Church, eating meat on Friday is a sin that deserves eternal punishment.
      And yet, in the nature of things, the consequences of eating meat on that
      day must be exactly the same as eating meat on any other. So, all the
      churches teach that unbelief is a crime, not in the nature of things, but
      by reason of the will of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course this is absurd and idiotic. If there be an infinite God he
      cannot make that wrong which in the nature of things is right. Neither can
      he make an action good the natural consequences of which are evil. Even an
      infinite God cannot change a fact. In spite of him the relation between
      the diameter and circumference of a circle would remain the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the relations of things to things, of forces to forces, of acts to
      acts, of causes to effects in the domain of what is called matter, and in
      the realm of what is called mind, are just as certain, just as
      unchangeable as the relation between the diameter and circumference of a
      circle.
    </p>
    <p>
      An infinite God could not make ingratitude a virtue any easier than he
      could make a square triangle.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, the foundations of the moral and the immoral are in the nature of
      things&mdash;in the necessary relation between conduct and well-being, and
      an infinite God cannot change these foundations, and cannot increase or
      diminish the natural consequences of actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this world there is neither chance nor caprice, neither magic nor
      miracle. Behind every event, every thought and dream, is the efficient,
      the natural and necessary cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effort to make the will of a supposed God the foundation of morality,
      has filled the world with misery and crime, extinguished in millions of
      minds the light of reason, and in countless ways hindered and delayed the
      progress of our race.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligent men now know, that if there be an infinite God, man cannot in
      any way increase or decrease the happiness of such a being. They know that
      man can only commit crimes against sentient beings who, to some extent at
      least, are within his power, and that a crime by a finite being against an
      infinite being is an infinite impossibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI.
    </p>
    <p>
      FOR many thousands of years man has believed in and sought for the
      impossible. In chemistry he has searched for a universal solvent, for some
      way in which to change the baser metals into gold. Even Lord Bacon was a
      believer in this absurdity. Thousands of men, during many centuries, in
      thousands of ways, sought to change the nature of lead and iron so that
      they might be transformed to gold. They had no conception of the real
      nature of things. They supposed that they had originally been created by a
      kind of magic, and could by the same kind of magic be changed into
      something else. They were all believers in the supernatural. So, in
      mechanics, men sought for the impossible. They were believers in perpetual
      motion and they tried to make machines that would through a combination of
      levers furnish the force that propelled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thousands of ingenious men wasted their lives in the vain effort to
      produce machines that would in some wonderful way create a force. They did
      not know that force is eternal, that it can neither be created nor
      destroyed. They did not know that a machine having perpetual motion would
      necessarily be a universe within itself, or independent of this, and in
      which the force called friction would be necessarily changed, without
      loss, into the force that propelled,&mdash;the machine itself causing or
      creating the original force that put it in motion. And yet in spite of all
      the absurdities involved, for many centuries men, regarded by their
      fellows as intelligent and learned, tried to discover the great principle
      of "perpetual motion."
    </p>
    <p>
      Our ancestors studied the stars because in them they thought it possible
      to learn the fate of nations, the life and destiny of the individual.
      Eclipses, wandering comets, the relations of certain stars were the
      forerunners or causes of prosperity or disaster, of the downfall or
      upbuilding of kingdoms. Astrology was believed to be a science, and those
      who studied the stars were consulted by warriors, statesmen and kings. The
      account of the star that led the wise men of the East to the infant Christ
      was written by a believer in astrology. It would be hard to overstate the
      time and talent wasted in the study of this so-called science. The men who
      believed in astrology thought that they lived in a supernatural world&mdash;a
      world in which causes and effects had no necessary connection with each
      other&mdash;in which all events were the result of magic and necromancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even now, at the close of the nineteenth century, there are hundreds and
      hundreds of men who make their living by casting the horoscopes of idiots
      and imbeciles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "perpetual motion" of the mechanic, the universal solvent of the
      chemist, the changing of lead into gold, the foretelling events by the
      relations of stars were all born of the same ignorance of nature that
      caused the theologian to imagine an uncaused cause as the cause of all
      causes and effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      The theologian insisted that there was something superior to nature, and
      that that something was the creator and preserver of nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course there is no more evidence of the existence of that "something"
      than there is of the philosopher's stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mechanics who now believe in perpetual motion are insane, so are the
      chemists who seek to change one metal into another, so are the honest
      astrologers, and in a few more years the same can truthfully be said of
      the honest theologians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of our ancestors believed in the existence of and sought for the
      Fountain of Perpetual Youth. They believed that an old man could stoop and
      drink from this fountain and that while he drank his gray hairs would
      slowly change, that the wrinkles would disappear, that his dim eyes would
      brighten and grow clear, his heart throb with manhood's force and rhythm,
      while in his pallid cheeks would burst into blossom the roses of health.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were believers in the supernatural, the miraculous, and nothing
      seemed more probable than the impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      MOST people use names in place of arguments. They are satisfied to be
      disciples, followers of the illustrious dead. Each church, each party has
      a list of "great men," and they throw the names of these men at each other
      when discussing their dogmas and creeds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Men prove the inspiration of the Bible, the divinity of Christ by the
      admissions of soldiers, statesmen and kings. And in the same way they
      establish the existence of heaven and hell. Dispute one of their dogmas
      and you will instantly be told that Isaac Newton or Matthew Hale was on
      the other side, and you will be asked whether you claim to be superior to
      Newton or Hale. In our own country the ministers, to establish their
      absurdities, quote the opinions of Webster and of other successful
      politicians as though such opinions were demonstrations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Protestants will cheerfully admit that they are inferior in brain and
      genius to some men who have lived and died in the Catholic faith; that in
      the matter of preaching funeral sermons they are not equal to Bossuet;
      that their letters are not as interesting and polished as those written by
      Pascal; that Torquemada excelled them in the genius of organization, and
      that for planning a massacre they would not for a moment claim the palm
      from Catherine de Medici, and yet after these admissions, these same
      Protestants would insist that the Pope is an unblushing impostor, and the
      Catholic Church a vampire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The so-called "great men" of the world have been mistaken in many things.
      Lord Bacon denied the Copernican system of astronomy and believed to the
      day of his death that the sun and stars journeyed about this little earth.
      Matthew Hale was a firm believer in the existence of witches and wizards.
      John Wesley believed that earthquakes were caused by sin and that they
      could be prevented by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ. John Calvin
      regarded murder as one of the means to preserve the purity of the gospel.
      Martin Luther denounced Galileo as a fool because he was opposed to the
      astronomy of Moses. Webster was in favor of the Fugitive Slave Law and
      held the book of Job in high esteem. He wanted votes and he knelt to the
      South. He wanted votes and he flattered the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII.
    </p>
    <p>
      VOLUMES might be written on the follies and imbecilities of "great" men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only a few years ago the really great men were persecuted, imprisoned or
      burned. In this way the church was enabled to keep the "great" men on her
      side.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a matter of fact it is impossible to tell what the "great" men really
      thought. We only know what they said. These "great" men had families to
      support, they had a prejudice against prisons and objected to being
      burned, and it may be that they thought one way and talked another.
    </p>
    <p>
      The priests said to these men: "Agree with the creed, talk on our side, or
      you will be persecuted to the death." Then the priests turned to the
      people and cried: "Hear what the great men say."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few years we have had something like liberty of speech and many men
      have told their thoughts. Now the theologians are not quite so apt to
      appeal to names as formerly. The really great are not on their side. The
      leaders of modern thought are not Christians. Now the unbelievers can
      repeat names&mdash;names that stand for intellectual triumphs. Humboldt,
      Helmholtz, Haeckel and Huxley, Darwin, Spencer and Tyndall and many
      others, stand for investigation, discovery, for vast achievements in the
      world of thought. These men were and are thinkers and they had and have
      the courage to express their thoughts. They were not and are not puppets
      of priests, or the trembling worshipers of ghosts.
    </p>
    <p>
      For many years, most of the presidents of American colleges have been
      engaged in the pious work of trying to prevent the intellectual
      advancement of the race. To such an extent have they succeeded that none
      of their students have been or are great scientists.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the purpose of bolstering their creed the orthodox do not now repeat
      the names of the living, their witnesses are in the cemetery. All the
      "great" Christians are dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day we want arguments, not names, reasons, not opinions. It is
      degrading to blindly follow a man, or a church. Nothing is nobler than to
      be governed by reason. To be vanquished by the truth is to be a victor.
      The man who follows is a slave. The man who thinks is free.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must remember that most men have been controlled by their surroundings.
      Most of the intelligent men in Turkey are followers of Mahomet. They were
      rocked in the cradle of the Koran, they received their religious opinions
      as they did their features&mdash;from their parents. Their opinion on the
      subject of religion is of no possible value. The same may be said of the
      Christians of our country. Their belief is the result, not of thought, of
      investigation, but of surroundings.
    </p>
    <p>
      All religions have been the result of ignorance, and the seeds were sown
      and planted in the long night of savagery.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the decline of the Roman power, in the times when prosperity died, when
      commerce almost ceased, when the sceptre of authority fell from weak and
      nerveless hands, when arts were lost and the achievements of the past
      forgotten or unknown, then Christians came, and holding in contempt all
      earthly things, told their fellows of another world&mdash;of joy eternal
      beyond the clouds.

      If learning had not been lost, if the people had been educated, if they
      had known the literature of Greece and Rome, if they had been familiar
      with the tragedies of &#65533;?schylus, Sophocles and Euripides, with the
      philosophy of Zeno and Epicurus, with the orations of Demosthenes; if they
      had known the works of art, the miracles of genius, the passions in
      marble, the dreams in stone; if they had known the history of Rome; if
      they had understood Lucretius, Cicero and C&aelig;sar; if they had studied
      the laws, the decisions of the Pr&aelig;tors; if they had known the
      thoughts of all the mighty dead, there would have been no soil on which
      the seeds of Christian superstition could have taken root and grown.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the early Christians hated art, and song, and joy. They slandered and
      maligned the human race, insisted that the world had been blighted by the
      curse of God, that this life should be used only in making preparation for
      the next, that education filled the mind with doubt, and science led the
      soul from God.

      IX.
    </p>
    <p>
      THERE are two ways. One is to live for God. That has been tried, and the
      result has always been the same. It was tried in Palestine many years ago
      and the people who tried it were not protected by their God. They were
      conquered, overwhelmed and exiled. They lost their country and were
      scattered over the earth. For many centuries they expected assistance from
      their God. They believed that they would be gathered together again, that
      their cities and temples and altars would be rebuilt, that they would
      again be the favorites of Jehovah, that with his help they would overcome
      their enemies and rule the world. Century by century the hope has grown
      weaker and weaker, until now it is regarded by the intelligent as a
      foolish dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living for God was tried in Switzerland and it ended in slavery and
      torture. Every avenue that led to improvement, to progress, was closed.
      Only those in authority were allowed to express their thoughts. No one
      tried to increase the happiness of people in this world. Innocent pleasure
      was regarded as sin, laughter was suppressed, all natural joy despised,
      and love itself denounced as sin.
    </p>
    <p>
      They amused themselves with fasting and prayer, hearing sermons, talking
      about endless pain, committing to memory the genealogies in the Old
      Testament, and now and then burning one of their fellow-men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living for God was tried in Scotland. The people became the serfs and
      slaves of the blessed Kirk. The ministers became petty tyrants. They
      poisoned the very springs of life. They interfered with every family,
      invaded the privacy of every home, sowed the seeds of superstition and
      fear, and filled the darkness with devils. They claimed to be divinely
      inspired, that they delivered the messages of God, that to deny their
      authority was blasphemy, and that all who refused to do their bidding
      would suffer eternal pain. Under their government Scotland was a land of
      sighing and sorrow, of grief and pain. The people were slaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living for God was tried in New England. A government was formed in
      accordance with the Old Testament. The laws, for the most part, were petty
      and absurd, the penalties cruel and bloody to the last degree. Religious
      liberty was regarded as a crime, as an insult to God. Persons differing in
      belief from those in power, were persecuted, whipped, maimed and exiled.
      People supposed to be in league with the devil were imprisoned or killed.
      A theological government was established, ministers were the agents of
      God, they dictated the laws and fixed the penalties. Everything was under
      the supervision of the clergy. They had no pity, no mercy. With all their
      hearts they hated the natural. They promised happiness in another world,
      and did all they could to destroy the pleasures of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their greatest consolation, their purest joy was found in their belief
      that all who failed to obey their words, to wear their yoke, would suffer
      infinite torture in the eternal dungeons of hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Living for God was tried in the Dark Ages. Thousands of scaffolds were wet
      with blood, countless swords were thrust through human hearts. The flames
      of fagots consumed the flesh of men, dungeons became the homes of those
      who thought. In the name of God every cruelty was practiced, every crime
      committed, and liberty perished from the earth. Everywhere the result has
      been the same. Living for God has filled the world with blood and flame.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another way. Let us live for man, for this world. Let us develop
      the brain and civilize the heart. Let us ascertain the conditions of
      happiness and live in accordance with them. Let us do what we can for the
      destruction of ignorance, poverty and crime. Let us do our best to supply
      the wants of the body, to satisfy the hunger of the mind, to ascertain the
      secrets of nature, to the end that we may make the invisible forces the
      tireless servants of the human race, and fill the world with happy homes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the gods take care of themselves. Let us live for man. Let us remember
      that those who have sought for the truths of nature have never persecuted
      their fellow-men. The astronomers and chemists have forged no chains,
      built no dungeons. The geologists have invented no instrument of torture.
      The philosophers have not demonstrated the truth of their theories by
      burning their neighbors. The great infidels, the thinkers, have lived for
      the good of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is noble to seek for truth, to be intellectually honest, to give to
      others a true transcript of your mind, a photograph of your thoughts in
      honest words.
    </p>
    <p>
      X.
    </p>
    <p>
      HERE are two ways: The narrow way along which the selfish go in single
      file, not wide enough for husband and wife to walk side by side while
      children clasp their hands. The narrow road over the desert of
      superstition "with here and there a traveler." The narrow grass-grown
      path, filled with flints and broken glass, bordered by thistles and
      thorns, where the twice-born limping walk with bleeding feet. If by this
      path you see a flower, do not pick it. It is a temptation. Beneath its
      leaves a serpent lies. Keep your eyes on the New Jerusalem. Do not look
      back for wife or child or friend. Think only of saving your own soul. You
      will be just as happy in heaven with all you love in hell. Believe, have
      faith, and you will be rewarded for the goodness of another. Look neither
      to the right nor left. Keep on, straight on, and you will save your
      worthless, withered, selfish soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the narrow road that leads from earth to the Christian's heartless
      heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is another way&mdash;the broad road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Give me the wide and ample way, the way broad enough for us all to go
      together. The broad way where the birds sing, where the sun shines and the
      streams murmur. The broad way, through the fields where the flowers grow,
      over the daisied slopes where sunlight, lingering, seems to sleep and
      dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us go the broad way with the great world, with science and art, with
      music and the drama, with all that gladdens, thrills, refines and calms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us go the wide road with husband and wife, with children and friends
      and with all there is of joy and love between the dawn and dusk of life's
      strange day.
    </p>
    <p>
      This world is a great orange tree filled with blossoms, with ripening and
      ripened fruit, while, underneath the bending boughs, the fallen slowly
      turn to dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each orange is a life. Let us squeeze it dry, get all the juice there is,
      so that when death comes we can say; "There is nothing left but withered
      peel."
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us travel the broad and natural way. Let us live for man.
    </p>
    <p>
      To think of what the world has suffered from superstition, from religion,
      from the worship of beast and stone and god, is almost enough to make one
      insane. Think of the long, long night of ignorance and fear! Think of the
      agony, the sufferings of the past, of the days that are dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      I look. In gloomy caves I see the sacred serpents coiled, waiting for
      their sacrificial prey. I see their open jaws, their restless tongues,
      their glittering eyes, their cruel fangs. I see them seize and crush in
      many horrid folds the helpless children given by fathers and mothers to
      appease the Serpent-God. I look again. I see temples wrought of stone and
      gilded with barbaric gold. I see altars red with human blood. I see the
      solemn priests thrust knives in the white breasts of girls. I look again.
      I see other temples and other altars, where greedy flames devour the flesh
      and blood of babes. I see other temples and other priests and other altars
      dripping with the blood of oxen, lambs and doves.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look again. I see other temples and other priests and other altars on
      which are sacrificed the liberties of man. I look. I see the cathedrals of
      God, the huts of peasants, the robes of priests and kings, the rags of
      honest men. I look again. The lovers of God are the murderers of men. I
      see dungeons filled with the noblest and the best. I see exiles,
      wanderers, outcasts, millions of martyrs, widows and orphans. I see the
      cunning instruments of torture and hear the shrieks and sobs and moans of
      millions dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      I see the dungeon's gloom, I hear the clank of chains. I see the fagot's
      flames, the scorched and blackened face, the writhing limbs. I hear the
      jeers and scoffs of pious fiends. I see the victim on the rack, I hear the
      tendons as they break. I see a world beneath the feet of priests, liberty
      in chains, every virtue a crime, every crime a virtue, intelligence
      despised, stupidity sainted, hypocrisy crowned and the white forehead of
      honor wearing the brand of shame. This was.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look again, and in the East of hope's fair sky the first pale light shed
      by the herald star gives promise of another dawn. I look, and from the
      ashes, blood and tears the heroes leap to bless the future and avenge the
      past. I see a world at war, and in the storm and chaos of the deadly
      strife thrones crumble, altars fall, chains break, creeds change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The highest peaks are touched with holy light. The dawn has blossomed. I
      look again. I see discoverers sailing across mysterious seas. I see
      inventors cunningly enslave the forces of the world. I see the houses
      being built for schools. Teachers, interpreters of nature, slowly take the
      place of priests. Philosophers arise, thinkers give the world their wealth
      of brain, and lips grow rich with words of truth. This is.
    </p>
    <p>
      I look again, but toward the future now. The popes and priests and kings
      are gone,&mdash;the altars and the thrones have mingled with the dust,&mdash;the
      aristocracy of land and cloud have perished from the earth and-air, and
      all the gods are dead. A new religion sheds its glory on mankind. It is
      the gospel of this world, the religion of the body, of the heart and
      brain, the evangel of health and joy. I see a world at peace, where labor
      reaps its true reward, a world without prisons, without workhouses,
      without asylums for the insane, a world on which the gibbets shadow does
      not fall, a world where the poor girl, trying to win bread with the
      needle, the needle that has been called "the asp for the breast of the
      poor," is not driven to the desperate choice of crime or death, of suicide
      or shame. I see a world without the beggar's outstretched palm, the
      miser's heartless, stony stare, the piteous wail of want, the pallid face
      of crime, the livid lips of lies, the cruel eyes of scorn. I see a race
      without disease of flesh or brain, shapely and fair, the married harmony
      of form and use, and as I look life lengthens, fear dies, joy deepens,
      love intensifies. The world is free. This shall be.

    <h2>
      ABOUT THE HOLY BIBLE.
    </h2>
    <p>
      SOMEBODY ought to tell the truth about the Bible. The preachers dare not,
      because they would be driven from their pulpits. Professors in colleges
      dare not, because they would lose their salaries. Politicians dare not.
      They would be defeated. Editors dare not. They would lose subscribers.
      Merchants dare not, because they might lose customers. Men of fashion dare
      not, fearing that they would lose caste. Even clerks dare not, because
      they might be discharged. And so I thought I would do it myself.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are many millions of people who believe the Bible to be the inspired
      word of God&mdash;millions who think that this book is staff and guide,
      counselor and consoler; that it fills the present with peace and the
      future with hope&mdash;millions who believe that it is the fountain of
      law, justice and mercy, and that to its wise and benign teachings the
      world is indebted for its liberty, wealth and civilization&mdash;millions
      who imagine that this book is a revelation from the wisdom and love of God
      to the brain and heart of man&mdash;millions who regard this book as a
      torch that conquers the darkness of death, and pours its radiance on
      another world&mdash;a world without a tear.
    </p>
    <p>
      They forget its ignorance and savagery, its hatred of liberty, its
      religious persecution; they remember heaven, but they forget the dungeon
      of eternal pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They forget that it imprisons the brain and corrupts the heart. They
      forget that it is the enemy of intellectual freedom. Liberty is my
      religion. Liberty of hand and brain&mdash;of thought and labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liberty is a word hated by kings&mdash;loathed by popes. It is a word that
      shatters thrones and altars&mdash;that leaves the crowned without
      subjects, and the outstretched hand of superstition without alms. Liberty
      is the blossom and fruit of justice&mdash;the perfume of mercy. Liberty is
      the seed and soil, the air and light, the dew and rain of progress, love
      and joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      I. THE ORIGIN OF THE BIBLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      A FEW wandering families&mdash;poor, wretched, without education, art or
      power; descendants of those who had been enslaved for four hundred years;
      ignorant as the inhabitants of Central Africa, had just escaped from their
      masters to the desert of Sinai.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their leader was Moses, a man who had been raised in the family of Pharaoh
      and had been taught the law and mythology of Egypt. For the purpose of
      controlling his followers he pretended that he was instructed and assisted
      by Jehovah, the God of these wanderers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything that happened was attributed to the interference of this God.
      Moses declared that he met this God face to face; that on Sinai's top from
      the hands of this God he had received the tables of stone on which, by the
      finger of this God, the Ten Commandments had been written, and that, in
      addition to this, Jehovah had made known the sacrifices and ceremonies
      that were pleasing to him and the laws by which the people should be
      governed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way the Jewish religion and the Mosaic Code were established.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now claimed that this religion and these laws were and are revealed
      and established for all mankind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time these wanderers had no commerce with other nations, they had
      no written language, they could neither read nor write. They had no means
      by which they could make this revelation known to other nations, and so it
      remained buried in the jargon of a few ignorant, impoverished and unknown
      tribes for more than two thousand years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many centuries after Moses, the leader, was dead&mdash;many centuries
      after all his followers had passed away&mdash;the Pentateuch was written,
      the work of many writers, and to give it force and authority it was
      claimed that Moses was the author.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now know that the Pentateuch was not written by Moses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towns are mentioned that were not in existence when Moses lived.
    </p>
    <p>
      Money, not coined until centuries after his death, is mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, many of the laws were not applicable to wanderers on the desert&mdash;laws
      about agriculture, about the sacrifice of oxen, sheep and doves, about the
      weaving of cloth, about ornaments of gold and silver, about the
      cultivation of land, about harvest, about the threshing of grain, about
      houses and temples, about cities of refuge, and about many other subjects
      of no possible application to a few starving wanderers over the sands and
      rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is now not only admitted by intelligent and honest theologians that
      Moses was not the author of the Pentateuch, but they all admit that no one
      knows who the authors were, or who wrote any one of these books, or a
      chapter or a line. We know that the books were not written in the same
      generation; that they were not all written by one person; that they are
      filled with mistakes and contradictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is also admitted that Joshua did not write the book that bears his
      name, because it refers to events that did not happen until long after his
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one knows, or pretends to know, the author of Judges; all we know is
      that it was written centuries after all the judges had ceased to exist. No
      one knows the author of Ruth, nor of First and Second Samuel; all we know
      is that Samuel did not write the books that bear his name. In the 25th
      chapter of First Samuel is an account of Samuel's death, and in the 27th
      chapter is an account of the raising of Samuel by the Witch of Endor.
    </p>
    <p>
      No one knows the author of First and Second Kings or First and Second
      Chronicles; all we know is that these books are of no value.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that the Psalms were not written by David. In the Psalms the
      Captivity is spoken of, and that did not happen until about five hundred
      years after David slept with his fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that Solomon did not write the Proverbs or the Song; that Isaiah
      was not the author of the book that bears his name; that no one knows the
      author of Job, Ecclesiastes, or Esther, or of any book in the Old
      Testament, with the exception of Ezra.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that God is not mentioned or in any way referred to in the book of
      Esther. We know, too, that the book is cruel, absurd and impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      God is not mentioned in the Song of Solomon, the best book in the Old
      Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      And we know that Ecclesiastes was written by an unbeliever.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know, too, that the Jews themselves had not decided as to what books
      were inspired&mdash;were authentic&mdash;until the second century after
      Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that the idea of inspiration was of slow growth, and that the
      inspiration was determined by those who had certain ends to accomplish.
    </p>
    <p>
      II.
    </p>
    <p>
      IF it is, it should be a book that no man&mdash;no number of men&mdash;could
      produce.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should contain the perfection of philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should perfectly accord with every fact in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      There should be no mistakes in astronomy, geology, or as to any subject or
      science.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its morality should be the highest, the purest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its laws and regulations for the control of conduct should be just, wise,
      perfect, and perfectly adapted to the accomplishment of the ends desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should contain nothing calculated to make man cruel, revengeful,
      vindictive or infamous.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be filled with intelligence, justice, purity, honesty, mercy and
      the spirit of liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be opposed to strife and war, to slavery and lust, to ignorance,
      credulity and superstition.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should develop the brain and civilize the heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should satisfy the heart and brain of the best and wisest.
    </p>
    <p>
      It should be true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does the Old Testament satisfy this standard?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything in the Old Testament&mdash;in history, in theory, in
      law, in government, in morality, in science&mdash;above and beyond the
      ideas, the beliefs, the customs and prejudices of its authors and the
      people among whom they lived?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there one ray of light from any supernatural source?
    </p>
    <p>
      The ancient Hebrews believed that this earth was the centre of the
      universe, and that the sun, moon and stars were specks in the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this the Bible agrees.
    </p>
    <p>
      They thought the earth was flat, with four corners; that the sky, the
      firmament, was solid&mdash;the floor of Jehovah's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bible teaches the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      They imagined that the sun journeyed about the earth, and that by stopping
      the sun the day could be lengthened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bible agrees with this.
    </p>
    <p>
      They believed that Adam and Eve were the first man and woman; that they
      had been created but a few years before, and that they, the Hebrews, were
      their direct descendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      This the Bible teaches.
    </p>
    <p>
      If anything is, or can be, certain, the writers of the Bible were mistaken
      about creation, astronomy, geology; about the causes of phenomena, the
      origin of evil and the cause of death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it must be admitted that if an Infinite Being is the author of the
      Bible, he knew all sciences, all facts, and could not have made a mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      If, then, there are mistakes, misconceptions, false theories, ignorant
      myths and blunders in the Bible, it must have been written by finite
      beings; that is to say, by ignorant and mistaken men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing can be clearer than this.
    </p>
    <p>
      For centuries the church insisted that the Bible was absolutely true; that
      it contained no mistakes; that the story of creation was true; that its
      astronomy and geology were in accord with the facts; that the scientists
      who differed with the Old Testament were infidels and atheists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this has changed. The educated Christians admit that the writers of
      the Bible were not inspired as to any science. They now say that God, or
      Jehovah, did not inspire the writers of his book for the purpose of
      instructing the world about astronomy, geology, or any science. They now
      admit that the inspired men who wrote the Old Testament knew nothing about
      any science, and that they wrote about the earth and stars, the sun and
      moon, in accordance with the general ignorance of the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      It required many centuries to force the theologians to this admission.
      Reluctantly, full of malice and hatred, the priests retired from the
      field, leaving the victory with science.
    </p>
    <p>
      They took another position:
    </p>
    <p>
      They declared that the authors, or rather the writers, of the Bible were
      inspired in spiritual and moral things; that Jehovah wanted to make known
      to his children his will and his infinite love for his children; that
      Jehovah, seeing his people wicked, ignorant and depraved, wished to make
      them merciful and just, wise and spiritual, and that the Bible is inspired
      in its laws, in the religion it teaches and in its ideas of government.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the issue now. Is the Bible any nearer right in its ideas of
      justice, of mercy, of morality or of religion than in its conception of
      the sciences?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it moral?
    </p>
    <p>
      It upholds slavery&mdash;it sanctions polygamy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Could a devil have done worse?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it merciful?
    </p>
    <p>
      In war it raised the black flag; it commanded the destruction, the
      massacre, of all&mdash;of the old, infirm, and helpless&mdash;of wives and
      babes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were its laws inspired?
    </p>
    <p>
      Hundreds of offences were punished with death. To pick up sticks on
      Sunday, to murder your father on Monday, were equal crimes. There is in
      the literature of the world no bloodier code. The law of revenge&mdash;of
      retaliation&mdash;was the law of Jehovah. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a
      tooth, a limb for a limb.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is savagery&mdash;not philosophy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it just and reasonable?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bible is opposed to religious toleration&mdash;to religious liberty.
      Whoever differed with the majority was stoned to death. Investigation was
      a crime. Husbands were ordered to denounce and to assist in killing their
      unbelieving wives.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is the enemy of Art. "Thou shalt make no graven image." This was the
      death of Art.
    </p>
    <p>
      Palestine never produced a painter or a sculptor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is the Bible civilized?
    </p>
    <p>
      It upholds lying, larceny, robbery, murder, the selling of diseased meat
      to strangers, and even the sacrifice of human beings to Jehovah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it philosophical?
    </p>
    <p>
      It teaches that the sins of a people can be transferred to an animal&mdash;to
      a goat. It makes maternity an offence for which a sin offering had to be
      made.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was wicked to give birth to a boy, and twice as wicked to give birth to
      a girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make hair-oil like that used by the priests was an offence punishable
      with death.
    </p>
    <p>
      The blood of a bird killed over running water was regarded as medicine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Would a civilized God daub his altars with the blood of oxen, lambs and
      doves? Would he make all his priests butchers? Would he delight in the
      smell of burning flesh?
    </p>
    <p>
      III. THE TEN COMMANDMENTS
    </p>
    <p>
      SOME Christian lawyers&mdash;some eminent and stupid judges&mdash;have
      said and still say, that the Ten Commandments are the foundation of all
      law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more absurd. Long before these commandments were given
      there were codes of laws in India and Egypt&mdash;laws against murder,
      perjury, larceny, adultery and fraud. Such laws are as old as human
      society; as old as the love of life; as old as industry; as the idea of
      prosperity; as old as human love.
    </p>
    <p>
      All of the Ten Commandments that are good were old; all that were new are
      foolish. If Jehovah had been civilized he would have left out the
      commandment about keeping the Sabbath, and in its place would have said:
      "Thou shalt not enslave thy fellow-men." He would have omitted the one
      about swearing, and said: "The man shall have but one wife, and the woman
      but one husband." He would have left out the one about graven images, and
      in its stead would have said: "Thou shalt not wage wars of extermination,
      and thou shalt not unsheathe the sword except in self-defence."
    </p>
    <p>
      If Jehovah, had been civilized, how much grander the Ten Commandments
      would have been.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that we call progress&mdash;the enfranchisement of man, of labor, the
      substitution of imprisonment for death, of fine for imprisonment, the
      destruction of polygamy, the establishing of free speech, of the rights of
      conscience; in short, all that has tended to the development and
      civilization of man; all the results of investigation, observation,
      experience and free thought; all that man has accomplished for the benefit
      of man since the close of the Dark Ages&mdash;has been done in spite of
      the Old Testament.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me further illustrate the morality, the mercy, the philosophy and
      goodness of the Old Testament:
    </p>
    <p>
      THE STORY OF ACHAN.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua took the City of Jericho. Before the fall of the city he declared
      that all the spoil taken should be given to the Lord.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this order Achan secreted a garment, some silver and gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward Joshua tried to take the city of Ai. He failed and many of his
      soldiers were slain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joshua sought for the cause of his defeat and he found that Achan had
      secreted a garment, two hundred shekels of silver and a wedge of gold. To
      this Achan confessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thereupon Joshua took Achan, his sons and his daughters, his oxen and
      his sheep&mdash;stoned them all to death and burned their bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is nothing to show that the sons and Daughters had committed any
      crime. Certainly, the oxen and sheep should not have been stoned to death
      for the crime of their owner. This was the justice, the mercy, of Jehovah!
    </p>
    <p>
      After Joshua had committed this crime, with the help of Jehovah he
      captured the city of Ai.
    </p>
    <p>
      THE STORY OF ELISHA.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he went up thence unto Bethel, and as he was going up by the way
      there came forth little children out of the city and mocked him, and said
      unto him, 'Go up, thou baldhead.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "And he turned back and looked at them, and cursed them in the name of the
      Lord. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood and tore forty
      and two children of them."
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the work of the good God&mdash;the merciful Jehovah!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE STORY OF DANIEL.
    </p>
    <p>
      King Darius had honored and exalted Daniel, and the native princes were
      jealous. So they induced the king to sign a decree to the effect that any
      man who should make a petition to any god or man except to King Darius,
      for thirty days, should be cast into the den of lions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward these men found that Daniel, with his face toward Jerusalem,
      prayed three times a day to Jehovah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon Daniel was cast into the den of lions; a stone was placed at the
      mouth of the den and sealed with the king's seal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The king passed a bad night. The next morning he went to the den and cried
      out to Daniel. Daniel answered and told the king that God had sent his
      angel and shut the mouths of the lions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel was taken out alive and well, and the king was converted and
      believed in Daniel's God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Darius, being then a believer in the true God, sent for the men who had
      accused Daniel, and for their wives and their children, and cast them all
      into the lions' den.
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the lions had the mastery of them, and brake all their bones in
      pieces, or ever they came at the bottom of the pit."
    </p>
    <p>
      What had the wives and little children done? How had they offended King
      Darius, the believer in Jehovah? Who protected Daniel? Jehovah! Who failed
      to protect the innocent wives and children? Jehovah!
    </p>
    <p>
      THE STORY OF JOSEPH.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pharaoh had a dream, and this dream was interpreted by Joseph.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to this interpretation there was to be in Egypt seven years of
      plenty, followed by seven years of famine. Joseph advised Pharaoh to buy
      all the surplus of the seven plentiful years and store it up against the
      years of famine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pharaoh appointed Joseph as his minister or agent, and ordered him to buy
      the grain of the plentiful years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the famine. The people came to the king for help. He told them
      to go to Joseph and do as he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph sold corn to the Egyptians until all their money was gone&mdash;until
      he had it all.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the money was gone the people said: "Give us corn and we will give
      you our cattle."
    </p>
    <p>
      Joseph let them have corn until all their cattle, their horses and their
      flocks had been given to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the people said: "Give us corn and we will give you our lands."
    </p>
    <p>
      So Joseph let them have corn until all their lands were gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the famine continued, and so the poor wretches sold themselves, and
      they became the servants of Pharoah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then Joseph gave them seed, and made an agreement with them that they
      should forever give one-fifth of all they raised to Pharaoh.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who enabled Joseph to interpret the dream of Pharaoh? Jehovah! Did he know
      at the time that Joseph would use the information thus given to rob and
      enslave the people of Egypt? Yes. Who produced the famine? Jehovah!
    </p>
    <p>
      It is perfectly apparent that the Jews did not think of Jehovah as the God
      of Egypt&mdash;the God of all the world. He was their God, and theirs
      alone. Other nations had gods, but Jehovah was the greatest of all. He
      hated other nations and other gods, and abhorred all religions except the
      worship of himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      IV. WHAT IS IT ALL WORTH?
    </p>
    <p>
      WILL some Christian scholar tell us the value of Genesis?
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that it is not true&mdash;that it contradicts itself. There are
      two accounts of the creation in the first and second chapters. In the
      first account birds and beasts were created before man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second, man was created before the birds and beasts.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first, fowls are made out of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second, fowls are made out of the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the first, Adam and Eve are created together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the second, Adam is made; then the beasts and birds, and then Eve is
      created from one of Adam's ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      These stories are far older than the Pentateuch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persian: God created the world in six days, a man called Adama, a woman
      called Evah, and then rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Etruscan, Babylonian, Phoenician, Chaldean and the Egyptian stories
      are much the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Persians, Greeks, Egyptians, Chinese and
    </p>
    <p>
      Hindus have their Garden of Eden and the Tree of Life.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Persians, the Babylonians, the Nubians, the people of Southern
      India, all had the story of the fall of man and the subtle serpent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Chinese say that sin came into the world by the disobedience of woman.
      And even the Tahitians tell us that man was created from the earth, and
      the first woman from one of his bones.
    </p>
    <p>
      All these stories are equally authentic and of equal value to the world,
      and all the authors were equally inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know also that the story of the flood is much older than the book of
      Genesis, and we know besides that it is not true.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know that this story in Genesis was copied from the Chaldean. There you
      find all about the rain, the ark, the animals, the dove that was sent out
      three times, and the mountain on which the ark rested.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the Hindus, Chinese, Parsees, Persians, Greeks, Mexicans and
      Scandinavians have substantially the same story.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also know that the account of the Tower of Babel is an ignorant and
      childish fable.
    </p>
    <p>
      What then is left in this inspired book of
    </p>
    <p>
      Genesis? Is there a word calculated to develop the heart or brain? Is
      there an elevated thought&mdash;any great principle&mdash;anything poetic&mdash;any
      word that bursts into blossom?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything except a dreary and detailed statement of things that
      never happened?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything in Exodus calculated to make men generous, loving and
      noble?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it well to teach children that God tortured the innocent cattle of the
      Egyptians&mdash;bruised them to death with hailstones&mdash;on account of
      the sins of Pharoah?
    </p>
    <p>
      Does it make us merciful to believe that God killed the firstborn of the
      Egyptians&mdash;the firstborn of the poor and suffering people&mdash;of
      the poor girl working at the mill&mdash;because of the wickedness of the
      king?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we believe that the gods of Egypt worked miracles? Did they change
      water into blood, and sticks into serpents?
    </p>
    <p>
      In Exodus there is not one original thought or line of value.
    </p>
    <p>
      We know, if we know anything, that this book was written by savages&mdash;savages
      who believed in slavery, polygamy and wars of extermination. We know that
      the story told is impossible, and that the miracles were never performed.
      This book admits that there are other gods besides Jehovah. In the 17th
      chapter is this verse: "Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods,
      for, in the thing wherein they dealt proudly, he was above them."
    </p>
    <p>
      So, in this blessed book is taught the duty of human sacrifice&mdash;the
      sacrifice of babes.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 22d chapter is this command: "Thou shalt not delay to offer the
      first of thy ripe fruits and of thy liquors: the first-born of thy sons
      thou shalt give unto me."
    </p>
    <p>
      Has Exodus been a help or a hindrance to the human race?
    </p>
    <p>
      Take from Exodus the laws common to all nations, and is there anything of
      value left?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything in Leviticus of importance? Is there a chapter worth
      reading? What interest have we in the clothes of priests, the curtains and
      candles of the tabernacle, the tongs and shovels of the altar or the
      hair-oil used by the Levites?
    </p>
    <p>
      Of what use the cruel code, the frightful punishments, the curses, the
      falsehoods and the miracles of this ignorant and infamous book?
    </p>
    <p>
      And what is there in the book of Numbers&mdash;with its sacrifices and
      water of jealousy, with its shew-bread and spoons, its kids and fine
      flour, its oil and candlesticks, its cucumbers, onions and manna&mdash;to
      assist and instruct mankind? What interest have we in the rebellion of
      Korah, the water of separation, the ashes of a red heifer, the brazen
      serpent, the water that followed the people uphill and down for forty
      years, and the inspired donkey of the prophet Balaam? Have these
      absurdities and cruelties&mdash;these childish, savage superstitions&mdash;helped
      to civilize the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything in Joshua&mdash;with its wars, its murders and
      massacres, its swords dripping with the blood of mothers and babes, its
      tortures, maimings and mutilations, its fraud and fury, its hatred and
      revenge&mdash;calculated to improve the world?
    </p>
    <p>
      Does not every chapter shock the heart of a good man? Is it a book to be
      read by children?
    </p>
    <p>
      The book of Joshua is as merciless as famine, as ferocious as the heart of
      a wild beast. It is a history&mdash;a justification&mdash;a sanctification
      of nearly every crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book of Judges is about the same, nothing but war and bloodshed; the
      horrible story of Jael and Sisera; of Gideon and his trumpets and
      pitchers; of Jephtha and his daughter, whom he murdered to please Jehovah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we find the story of Samson, in which a sun-god is changed to a
      Hebrew giant.
    </p>
    <p>
      Read this book of Joshua&mdash;read of the slaughter of women, of wives,
      of mothers and babes&mdash;read its impossible miracles, its ruthless
      crimes, and all done according to the commands of Jehovah, and tell me
      whether this book is calculated to make us forgiving, generous and loving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I admit that the history of Ruth is in some respects a beautiful and
      touching story; that it is naturally told, and that her love for Naomi was
      deep and pure. But in the matter of courtship we would hardly advise our
      daughters to follow the example of Ruth. Still, we must remember that Ruth
      was a widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything worth reading in the first and second books of Samuel?
      Ought a prophet of God to hew a captured king in pieces? Is the story of
      the ark, its capture and return of importance to us? Is it possible that
      it was right, just and merciful to kill fifty thousand men because they
      had looked into a box? Of what use to us are the wars of Saul and David,
      the stories of Goliath and the Witch of Endor? Why should Jehovah have
      killed Uzzah for putting forth his hand to steady the ark, and forgiven
      David for murdering Uriah and stealing his wife?
    </p>
    <p>
      According to "Samuel," David took a census of the people. This excited the
      wrath of Jehovah, and as a punishment he allowed David to choose seven
      years of famine, a flight of three months from pursuing enemies, or three
      days of pestilence. David, having confidence in God, chose the three days
      of pestilence; and, thereupon, God, the compassionate, on account of the
      sin of David, killed seventy thousand innocent men!
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the same circumstances, what would a devil have done?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything in First and Second Kings that suggests the idea of
      inspiration?
    </p>
    <p>
      When David is dying he tells his son Solomon to murder Joab&mdash;not to
      let his hoar head go down to the grave in peace. With his last breath he
      commands his son to bring down the hoar head of Shimei to the grave with
      blood. Having uttered these merciful words, the good David, the man after
      God's heart, slept with his fathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it necessary to inspire the man who wrote the history of the building
      of the temple, the story of the visit of the Queen of Sheba, or to tell
      the number of Solomon's wives?
    </p>
    <p>
      What care we for the withering of Jereboam's hand, the prophecy of Jehu,
      or the story of Elijah and the ravens?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we believe that Elijah brought flames from heaven, or that he went at
      last to Paradise in a chariot of fire?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we believe in the multiplication of the widow's oil by Elisha, that an
      army was smitten with blindness, or that an axe floated in the water?
    </p>
    <p>
      Does it civilize us to read about the beheading of the seventy sons of
      Ahab, the putting out of the eyes of Zedekiah and the murder of his sons?
      Is there one word in First and Second Kings calculated to make men better?
    </p>
    <p>
      First and Second Chronicles is but a re-telling of what is told in First
      and Second Kings. The same old stories&mdash;a little left out, a little
      added, but in no respect made better or worse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The book of Ezra is of no importance. He tells us that Cyrus, King of
      Persia, issued a proclamation for building a temple at Jerusalem, and that
      he declared Jehovah to be the real and only God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more absurd. Ezra tells us about the return from
      captivity, the building of the temple, the dedication, a few prayers, and
      this is all. This book is of no importance, of no use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nehemiah is about the same, only it tells of the building of the wall, the
      complaints of the people about taxes, a list of those who returned from
      Babylon, a catalogue of those who dwelt at Jerusalem, and the dedication
      of the walls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word in Nehemiah worth reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then comes the book of Esther:
    </p>
    <p>
      In this we are told that King Ahasueras was intoxicated; that he sent for
      his Queen, Vashti, to come and show herself to him and his guests. Vashti
      refused to appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      This maddened the king, and he ordered that from every province the most
      beautiful girls should be brought before him that he might choose one in
      place of Vashti.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among others was brought Esther, a Jewess. She was chosen and became the
      wife of the king. Then a gentleman by the name of Haman wanted to have all
      the Jews killed, and the king, not knowing that Esther was of that race,
      signed a decree that all the Jews should be killed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through the efforts of Mordecai and Esther the decree was annulled and the
      Jews were saved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Haman prepared a gallows on which to have Mordecai hanged, but the good
      Esther so managed matters that Haman and his ten sons were hanged on the
      gallows that Haman had built, and the Jews were allowed to murder more
      than seventy-five thousand of the king's subjects.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the inspired story of Esther.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the book of Job we find some elevated sentiments, some sublime and
      foolish thoughts, something of the wonder and sublimity of nature, the
      joys and sorrows of life; but the story is infamous.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the Psalms are good, many are indifferent, and a few are infamous.
      In them are mingled the vices and virtues. There are verses that elevate,
      verses that degrade. There are prayers for forgiveness and revenge. In the
      literature of the world there is nothing more heartless, more infamous,
      than the 109th Psalm.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Proverbs there is much shrewdness, many pithy and prudent maxims,
      many wise sayings. The same ideas are expressed in many ways&mdash;the
      wisdom of economy and silence, the dangers of vanity and idleness. Some
      are trivial, some are foolish, and many are wise. These proverbs are not
      generous&mdash;not altruistic. Sayings to the same effect are found among
      all nations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ecclesiastes is the most thoughtful book in the Bible. It was written by
      an unbeliever&mdash;a philosopher&mdash;an agnostic. Take out the
      interpolations, and it is in accordance with the thought of the nineteenth
      century. In this book are found the most philosophic and poetic passages
      in the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      After crossing the desert of death and crime&mdash;after reading the
      Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings and Chronicles&mdash;it is
      delightful to reach this grove of palms, called the "Song of Solomon." A
      drama of love&mdash;of human love; a poem without Jehovah&mdash;a poem
      born of the heart and true to the divine instincts of the soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I sleep, but my heart waketh."
    </p>
    <p>
      Isaiah is the work of several. Its swollen words, its vague imagery, its
      prophecies and curses, its ravings against kings and nations, its laughter
      at the wisdom of man, its hatred of joy, have not the slightest tendency
      to increase the well-being of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this book is recorded the absurdest of all miracles. The shadow on the
      dial is turned back ten degrees, in order to satisfy Hezekiah that Jehovah
      will add fifteen years to his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this miracle the world, turning from west to east at the rate of more
      than a thousand miles an hour, is not only stopped, but made to turn the
      other way until the shadow on the dial went back ten degrees! Is there in
      the whole world an intelligent man or woman who believes this impossible
      falsehood?
    </p>
    <p>
      Jeremiah contains nothing of importance&mdash;no facts of value; nothing
      but fault-finding, lamentations, croakings, wailings, curses and promises;
      nothing but famine and prayer, the prosperity of the wicked, the ruin of
      the Jews, the captivity and return, and at last Jeremiah, the traitor, in
      the stocks and in prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Lamentations is simply a continuance of the ravings of the same insane
      pessimist; nothing but dust and sackcloth and ashes, tears and howls,
      railings and revilings.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Ezekiel&mdash;eating manuscripts, prophesying siege and desolation,
      with visions of coals of fire, and cherubim, and wheels with eyes, and the
      type and figure of the boiling pot, and the resurrection of dry bones&mdash;is
      of no use, of no possible value.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Voltaire, I say that any one who admires Ezekiel should be compelled
      to dine with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Daniel is a disordered dream&mdash;a nightmare.
    </p>
    <p>
      What can be made of this book with its image with a golden head, with
      breast and arms of silver, with belly and thighs of brass, with legs of
      iron, and with feet of iron and clay; with its writing on the wall, its
      den of lions, and its vision of the ram and goat?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything to be learned from Hosea and his wife? Is there anything
      of use in Joel, in Amos, in Obadiah? Can we get any good from Jonah and
      his gourd? Is it possible that God is the real author of Micah and Nahum,
      of Habakkuk and Zephaniah, of Haggai and Malachi and Zechariah, with his
      red horses, his four horns, his four carpenters, his flying roll, his
      mountains of brass and the stone with four eyes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything in these "inspired" books that has been of benefit to
      man?
    </p>
    <p>
      Have they taught us how to cultivate the earth, to build houses, to weave
      cloth, to prepare food? Have they taught us to paint pictures, to chisel
      statues, to build bridges, or ships, or anything of beauty or of use? Did
      we get our ideas of government, of religious freedom, of the liberty of
      thought, from the Old Testament? Did we get from any of these books a hint
      of any science? Is there in the "sacred volume" a word, a line, that has
      added to the wealth, the intelligence and the happiness of mankind? Is
      there one of the books of the Old Testament as entertaining as "Robinson
      Crusoe," "The Travels of Gulliver," or "Peter Wilkins and his Flying
      Wife"? Did the author of Genesis know as much about nature as Humboldt, or
      Darwin, or Haeckel? Is what is called the Mosaic Code as wise or as
      merciful as the code of any civilized nation? Were the writers of Kings
      and Chronicles as great historians, as great writers, as Gibbon and
      Draper? Is Jeremiah, or Habakkuk equal to Dickens or Thackeray? Can the
      authors of Job and the Psalms be compared with Shakespeare? Why should we
      attribute the best to man and the worst to God?
    </p>
    <p>
      V. WAS JEHOVAH A GOD OF LOVE?
    </p>
    <p>
      Did these words come from the heart of love?&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      "When the Lord thy God shall drive them before thee, thou shalt smite them
      and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no covenant with them, or show
      mercy unto them."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will heap mischief upon them. I will send mine arrows upon them; they
      shall be burned with hunger and devoured with burning heat and with bitter
      destruction."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will send the tooth of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of
      the dust."
    </p>
    <p>
      "The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young man
      and the virgin; the suckling also with the man of gray hairs."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow; let his children be
      continually vagabonds and beg; let them seek their bread also out of their
      desolate places; let the extortioner catch all that he hath, and let the
      stranger spoil his labor; let there be none to extend mercy unto him,
      neither let there be any to favor his fatherless children."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body&mdash;the flesh of thy
      sons and daughters."
    </p>
    <p>
      "And the heaven that is over thee shall be brass, and the earth that is
      under thee shall be iron."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will make my arrows drunk with blood."
    </p>
    <p>
      "I will laugh at their calamity.".
    </p>
    <p>
      Did these curses, these threats, come from the heart of love or from the
      mouth of savagery?
    </p>
    <p>
      Was Jehovah god or devil?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why should we place Jehovah above all the gods?
    </p>
    <p>
      Has man in his ignorance and fear ever imagined a greater monster?
    </p>
    <p>
      Have the barbarians of any land, in any time, worshiped a more heartless
      god?
    </p>
    <p>
      Brahma was a thousand times nobler, and so was Osiris and Zeus and
      Jupiter. So was the supreme god of the Aztecs, to whom they offered only
      the perfume of flowers. The worst god of the Hindus, with his necklace of
      skulls and his bracelets of living snakes, was kind and merciful compared
      with Jehovah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared with Marcus Aurelius, how small Jehovah seems. Compared with
      Abraham Lincoln, how cruel, how contemptible, is this god.
    </p>
    <p>
      VI. JEHOVAH'S ADMINISTRATION.
    </p>
    <p>
      HE created the world, the hosts of heaven, a man and woman&mdash;placed
      them in a garden. Then the serpent deceived them, and they were cast out
      and made to earn their bread.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jehovah had been thwarted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he tried again. He went on for about sixteen hundred years trying to
      civilize the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      No schools, no churches, no Bible, no tracts&mdash;nobody taught to read
      or write. No Ten Commandments. The people grew worse and worse, until the
      merciful Jehovah sent the flood and drowned all the people except Noah and
      his family, eight in all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he started again, and changed their diet. At first Adam and Eve were
      vegetarians. After the flood Jehovah said: "Every moving thing that liveth
      shall be meat for you"&mdash;snakes and buzzards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he failed again, and at the Tower of Babel he dispersed and scattered
      the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding that he could not succeed with all the people, he thought he would
      try a few, so he selected Abraham and his descendants. Again he failed,
      and his chosen people were captured by the Egyptians and enslaved for four
      hundred years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he tried again&mdash;rescued them from Pharaoh and started for
      Palestine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he changed their diet, allowing them to eat only the beasts that
      parted the hoof and chewed the cud. Again he failed. The people hated him,
      and preferred the slavery of Egypt to the freedom of Jehovah. So he kept
      them wandering until nearly all who came from Egypt had died. Then he
      tried again&mdash;took them into Palestine and had them governed by
      judges.
    </p>
    <p>
      This, too, was a failure&mdash;no schools, no Bible. Then he tried kings,
      and the kings were mostly idolaters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the chosen people were conquered and carried into captivity by the
      Babylonians.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another failure.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then they returned, and Jehovah tried prophets&mdash;howlers and wailers&mdash;but
      the people grew worse and worse. No schools, no sciences, no arts, no
      commerce. Then Jehovah took upon himself flesh, was born of a woman, and
      lived among the people that he had been trying to civilize for several
      thousand years. Then these people, following the law that Jehovah had
      given them in the wilderness, charged this Jehovah-man&mdash;this Christ&mdash;with
      blasphemy; tried, convicted and killed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jehovah had failed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he deserted the Jews and turned his attention to the rest of the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now the Jews, deserted by Jehovah, persecuted by Christians, are the
      most prosperous people on the earth. Again has Jehovah failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an administration!
    </p>
    <p>
      VII. THE NEW TESTAMENT.
    </p>
    <p>
      WHO wrote the New Testament?
    </p>
    <p>
      Christian scholars admit that they do not know. They admit that, if the
      four gospels were written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, they must have
      been written in Hebrew. And yet a Hebrew manuscript of any one of these
      gospels has never been found. All have been and are in Greek. So, educated
      theologians admit that the Epistles, James and Jude, were written by
      persons who had never seen one of the four gospels. In these Epistles&mdash;in
      James and Jude&mdash;no reference is made to any of the gospels, nor to
      any miracle recorded in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first mention that has been found of one of our gospels was made about
      one hundred and eighty years after the birth of Christ, and the four
      gospels were first named and quoted from at the beginning of the third
      century, about one hundred and seventy years after the death of Christ.
    </p>
    <p>
      We now know that there were many other gospels besides our four, some of
      which have been lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were the gospels of Paul, of the Egyptians, of the Hebrews, of
      Perfection, of Judas, of Thaddeus, of the Infancy, of Thomas, of Mary, of
      Andrew, of Nicodemus, of Marcion and several others.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there were the Acts of Pilate, of Andrew, of Mary, of Paul and Thecla
      and of many others; also a book called the Shepherd of Hermas.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first not one of all the books was considered as inspired. The Old
      Testament was regarded as di vine; but the books that now constitute the
      New Testament were regarded as human productions. We now know that we do
      not know who wrote the four gospels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question is, Were the authors of these four gospels inspired?
    </p>
    <p>
      If they were inspired, then the four gospels must be true. If they are
      true, they must agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      The four gospels do not agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew, Mark and Luke knew nothing of the atonement, nothing of salvation
      by faith. They knew only the gospel of good deeds&mdash;of charity. They
      teach that if we forgive others God will forgive us.
    </p>
    <p>
      With this the gospel of John does not agree.
    </p>
    <p>
      In that gospel we are taught that we must believe on the Lord Jesus
      Christ; that we must be born again; that we must drink the blood and eat
      the flesh of Christ. In this gospel we find the doctrine of the atonement
      and that Christ died for us and suffered in our place.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gospel is utterly at variance with, the other three. If the other
      three are true, the gospel of John is false. If the gospel of John was
      written by an inspired man, the writers of the other three were
      uninspired. From this there is no possible escape. The four cannot be
      true.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is evident that there are many interpolations in the four gospels.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, in the 28th chapter of Matthew is an account to the effect
      that the soldiers at the tomb of Christ were bribed to say that the
      disciples of Jesus stole away his body while they, the soldiers, slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is clearly an interpolation. It is a break in the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      The 10th verse should be followed by the 16th. The 10th verse is as
      follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then Jesus said unto them, 'Be not afraid; go tell my brethren that they
      go unto Galilee and there shall they see me.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The 16th verse:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Then the eleven disciples went away unto Galilee into a mountain, where
      Jesus had appointed them."
    </p>
    <p>
      The story about the soldiers contained in the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th and
      15th verses is an interpolation&mdash;an afterthought&mdash;long after.
      The 15th verse demonstrates this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifteenth verse: "So they took the money and did as they were taught. And
      this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly this account was not in the original gospel, and certainly the
      15th verse was not written by a Jew. No Jew could have written this: "And
      this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this day."
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark, John and Luke never heard that the soldiers had been bribed by the
      priests; or, if they had, did not think it worth while recording. So the
      accounts of the Ascension of Jesus Christ in Mark and Luke are
      interpolations. Matthew says nothing about the Ascension.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certainly there never was a greater miracle, and yet Matthew, who was
      present&mdash;who saw the Lord rise, ascend and disappear&mdash;did not
      think it worth mentioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the other hand, the last words of Christ, according to Matthew,
      contradict the Ascension: "Lo I am with you always, even unto the end of
      the world." John, who was present, if Christ really ascended, says not one
      word on the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the Ascension, the gospels do not agree. Mark gives the last
      conversation that Christ had with his disciples, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature. He that
      believeth and is baptised shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall
      be damned. And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name
      shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues. They shall
      take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt
      them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover. So, then,
      after the Lord had spoken unto them, he was received up into heaven and
      sat on the right hand of God."
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it possible that this description was written by one who witnessed this
      miracle?
    </p>
    <p>
      This miracle is described by Luke as follows: "And it came to pass while
      he blessed them he was parted from them and carried up into heaven."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Brevity is the soul of wit."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Acts we are told that: "When he had spoken, while they beheld, he
      was taken up, and a cloud received him out of their sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither Luke, nor Matthew, nor John, nor the writer of the Acts, heard one
      word of the conversation attributed to Christ by Mark. The fact is that
      the Ascension of Christ was not claimed by his disciples.
    </p>
    <p>
      At first Christ was a man&mdash;nothing more. Mary was his mother, Joseph
      his father. The genealogy of his father, Joseph, was given to show that he
      was of the blood of David.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the claim was made that he was the son of God, and that his mother
      was a virgin, and that she remained a virgin until her death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the claim was made that Christ rose from the dead and ascended bodily
      to heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      It required many years for these absurdities to take possession of the
      minds of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Christ rose from the dead, why did he not appear to his enemies? Why
      did he not call on Caiaphas, the high priest? Why did he not make another
      triumphal entry into Jerusalem?
    </p>
    <p>
      If he really ascended, why did he not do so in public, in the presence of
      his persecutors? Why should this, the greatest of miracles, be done in
      secret, in a corner?
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a miracle that could have been seen by a vast multitude&mdash;a
      miracle that could not be simulated&mdash;one that would have convinced
      hundreds of thousands.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the story of the Resurrection, the Ascension became a necessity.
      They had to dispose of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      So there are many other interpolations in the gospels and epistles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again I ask: Is the New Testament true? Does anybody now believe that at
      the birth of Christ there was a celestial greeting; that a star led the
      Wise Men of the Bast; that Herod slew the babes of Bethlehem of two years
      old and under?
    </p>
    <p>
      The gospels are filled with accounts of miracles. Were they ever
      performed?
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew gives the particulars of about twenty-two miracles, Mark of about
      nineteen, Luke of about eighteen and John of about seven.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the gospels, Christ healed diseases, cast out devils, rebuked
      the sea, cured the blind, fed multitudes with five loaves and two fishes,
      walked on the sea, cursed a fig tree, turned water into wine and raised
      the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matthew is the only one that tells about the Star and the Wise Men&mdash;the
      only one that tells about the murder of babes.
    </p>
    <p>
      John is the only one who says anything about the resurrection of Lazarus,
      and Luke is the only one giving an account of the raising from the dead
      the widow of Nain's son.
    </p>
    <p>
      How is it possible to substantiate these miracles?
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jews, among whom they were said to have been performed, did not
      believe them. The diseased, the palsied, the leprous, the blind who were
      cured, did not become followers of Christ. Those that were raised from the
      dead were never heard of again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does any intelligent man believe in the existence of devils? The writer of
      three of the gospels certainly did. John says nothing about Christ having
      cast out devils, but Matthew, Mark and Luke give many instances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does any natural man now believe that Christ cast out devils? If his
      disciples said he did, they were mistaken. If Christ said he did, he was
      insane or an impostor.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the accounts of casting out devils are false, then the writers were
      ignorant or dishonest. If they wrote through ignorance, then they were not
      inspired. If they wrote what they knew to be false, they were not
      inspired. If what they wrote is untrue, whether they knew it or not, they
      were not inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      At that time it was believed that palsy, epilepsy, deafness, insanity and
      many other diseases were caused by devils; that devils took possession of
      and lived in the bodies of men and women. Christ believed this, taught
      this belief to others, and pretended to cure diseases by casting devils
      out of the sick and insane. We know now, if we know anything, that
      diseases are not caused by the presence of devils. We know, if we know
      anything, that devils do not reside in the bodies of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Christ said and did what the writers of the three gospels say he said
      and did, then Christ was mistaken. If he was mistaken, certainly he was
      not God. And if he was mistaken, certainly he was not inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it a fact that the Devil tried to bribe Christ?
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it a fact that the Devil carried Christ to the top of the temple and
      tried to induce him to leap to the ground?
    </p>
    <p>
      How can these miracles be established?
    </p>
    <p>
      The principals have written nothing, Christ has written nothing, and the
      Devil has remained silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can we know that the Devil tried to bribe Christ? Who wrote the
      account? We do not know. How did the writer get his information? We do not
      know.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somebody, some seventeen hundred years ago, said that the Devil tried to
      bribe God; that the Devil carried God to the top of the temple and tried
      to induce him to leap to the earth and that God was intellectually too
      keen for the Devil.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is all the evidence we have.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there anything in the literature of the world more perfectly idiotic?
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligent people no longer believe in witches, wizards, spooks and
      devils, and they are perfectly satisfied that every word in the New
      Testament about casting out devils is utterly false.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we believe that Christ raised the dead?
    </p>
    <p>
      A widow living in Nain is following the body of her son to the tomb.
      Christ halts the funeral procession and raises the young man from the dead
      and gives him back to the arms of his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      This young man disappears. He is never heard of again. No one takes the
      slightest interest in the man who returned from the realm of death. Luke
      is the only one who tells the story. Maybe Matthew, Mark and John never
      heard of it, or did not believe it and so failed to record it.
    </p>
    <p>
      John says that Lazarus was raised from the dead; Matthew, Mark and Luke
      say nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was more wonderful than the raising of the widow's son. He had not been
      laid in the tomb for days. He was only on his way to the grave, but
      Lazarus was actually dead. He had begun to decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lazarus did not excite the least interest. No one asked him about the
      other world. No one inquired of him about their dead friends.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he died the second time no one said: "He is not afraid. He has
      traveled that road twice and knows just where he is going."
    </p>
    <p>
      We do not believe in the miracles of Mohammed, and yet they are as well
      attested as this. We have no confidence in the miracles performed by
      Joseph Smith, and yet the evidence is far greater, far better.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a man should go about now pretending to raise the dead, pretending to
      cast out devils, we would regard him as insane. What, then, can we say of
      Christ? If we wish to save his reputation we are compelled to say that he
      never pretended to raise the dead; that he never claimed to have cast out
      devils.
    </p>
    <p>
      We must take the ground that these ignorant and impossible things were
      invented by zealous disciples, who sought to deify their leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      In those ignorant days these falsehoods added to the fame of Christ. But
      now they put his character in peril and belittle the authors of the
      gospels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we now believe that water was changed into wine? John tells of this
      childish miracle, and says that the other disciples were present, yet
      Matthew, Mark and Luke say nothing about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      'Take the miracle of the man cured by the pool of Bethseda. John says that
      an angel troubled the waters of the pool of Bethseda, and that whoever got
      into the pool first after the waters were troubled was healed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Does anybody now believe that an angel went into the pool and troubled the
      waters? Does anybody now think that the poor wretch who got in first was
      healed? Yet the author of the gospel according to John believed and
      asserted these absurdities. If he was mistaken about that he may have been
      about all the miracles he records.
    </p>
    <p>
      John is the only one who tells about this pool of Bethseda. Possibly the
      other disciples did not believe the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      How can we account for these pretended miracles?
    </p>
    <p>
      In the days of the disciples, and for many centuries after, the world was
      filled with the supernatural. Nearly everything that happened was regarded
      as miraculous. God was the immediate governor of the world. If the people
      were good, God sent seed time and harvest; but if they were bad he sent
      flood and hail, frost and famine. If anything wonderful happened it was
      exaggerated until it became a miracle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the order of events&mdash;of the unbroken and the unbreakable chain of
      causes and effects&mdash;the people had no knowledge and no thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      A miracle is the badge and brand of fraud. No miracle ever was performed.
      No intelligent, honest man ever pretended to perform a miracle, and never
      will.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Christ had wrought the miracles attributed to him; if he had cured the
      palsied and insane; if he had given hearing to the deaf, vision to the
      blind; if he had cleansed the leper with a word, and with a touch had
      given life and feeling to the withered limb; if he had given pulse and
      motion, warmth and thought, to cold and breathless clay; if he had
      conquered death and rescued from the grave its pallid prey&mdash;no word
      would have been uttered, no hand raised, except in praise and honor. In
      his presence all heads would have been uncovered&mdash;all knees upon the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it not strange that at the trial of Christ no one was found to say a
      word in his favor? No man stood forth and said: "I was a leper, and this
      man cured me with a touch." No woman said: "I am the widow of Nain and
      this is my son whom this man raised from the dead."
    </p>
    <p>
      No man said: "I was blind, and this man gave me sight."
    </p>
    <p>
      All silent
    </p>
    <p>
      VIII. THE PHILOSOPHY OF CHRIST
    </p>
    <p>
      MILLIONS assert that the philosophy of Christ is perfect&mdash;that he was
      the wisest that ever littered speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let us see:
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Resist not evil. If smitten on one cheek turn the other</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any philosophy, any wisdom in this? Christ takes from goodness,
      from virtue, from the truth, the right of self-defence. Vice becomes the
      master of the world, and the good become the victims of the infamous.
    </p>
    <p>
      No man has the right to protect himself, his property, his wife and
      children. Government becomes impossible, and the world is at the mercy of
      criminals. Is there any absurdity beyond this?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Love your enemies</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is this possible? Did any human being ever love his enemies? Did Christ
      love his, when he denounced them as whited sepulchers, hypocrites and
      vipers?
    </p>
    <p>
      We cannot love those who hate us. Hatred in the hearts of others does not
      breed love in ours. Not to resist evil is absurd; to love your enemies is
      impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Take no thought for the morrow</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea was that God would take care of us as he did of sparrows and
      lilies. Is there the least sense in that belief?
    </p>
    <p>
      Does God take care of anybody?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we live without taking thought for the morrow? To plow, to sow, to
      cultivate, to harvest, is to take thought for the morrow. We plan and work
      for the future, for our children, for the unborn generations to come.
      Without this forethought there could be no progress, no civilization. The
      world would go back to the caves and dens of savagery.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>If thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out. If thy right hand offend
      thee, cut it off.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? Because it is better that one of our members should perish than that
      the whole body should be cast into hell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any wisdom in putting out your eyes or cutting off your hands? Is
      it possible to extract from these extravagant sayings the smallest grain
      of common sense?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Swear not at all; neither by Heaven, for it is God's throne; nor by the
      Earth, for it is his footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is his holy city.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Here we find the astronomy and geology of Christ. Heaven is the throne of
      God, the monarch; the earth is his footstool. A footstool that turns over
      at the rate of a thousand miles an hour, and sweeps through space at the
      rate of over a thousand miles a minute!
    </p>
    <p>
      Where did Christ think heaven was? Why was Jerusalem a holy city? Was it
      because the inhabitants were ignorant, cruel and superstitious?
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>If any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have
      thy cloak also</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is there any philosophy, any good sense, in that commandment? Would it not
      be just as sensible to say: "If a man obtains a judgment against you for
      one hundred dollars, give him two hundred."
    </p>
    <p>
      Only the insane could give or follow this advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>Think not I am come to send peace on earth. I came not to send peace,
      but a sword. For I am come to set a man at variance against his father,
      and the daughter against her mother.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If this is true, how much better it would have been had he remained away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Is it possible that he who said, "Resist not evil," came to bring a sword?
      That he who said, "Love your enemies," came to destroy the peace of the
      world?
    </p>
    <p>
      To set father against son, and daughter against father&mdash;what a
      glorious mission!
    </p>
    <p>
      He did bring a sword, and the sword was wet for a thousand years with
      innocent blood. In millions of hearts he sowed the seeds of hatred and
      revenge. He divided nations and families, put out the light of reason, and
      petrified the hearts of men.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or sisters, or
      father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, for my name's sake,
      shall receive an hundredfold, shall inherit everlasting life.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      According to the writer of Matthew, Christ, the compassionate, the
      merciful, uttered these terrible words. Is it possible that Christ offered
      the bribe of eternal joy to those who would desert their fathers, their
      mothers, their wives and children? Are we to win the happiness of heaven
      by deserting the ones we love? Is a home to be ruined here for the sake of
      a mansion there?
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet it is said that Christ is an example for all the world. Did he
      desert his father and mother? He said, speaking to his mother: "Woman,
      what have I to do with, thee?"
    </p>
    <p>
      The Pharisees said unto Christ: "Is it lawful to pay tribute unto C&aelig;sar?"
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ said: "Show me the tribute money." They brought him a penny. And he
      saith unto them: "Whose is the image and the superscription?" They said:
      "C&aelig;sar's." And Christ said: "Render unto C&aelig;sar the things that
      are C&aelig;sar's."
    </p>
    <p>
      Did Christ think that the money belonged to C&aelig;sar because his image
      and superscription were stamped upon it? Did the penny belong to C&aelig;sar
      or to the man who had earned it? Had C&aelig;sar the right to demand it
      because it was adorned with his image?
    </p>
    <p>
      Does it appear from this conversation that Christ understood the real
      nature and use of money?
    </p>
    <p>
      Can we now say that Christ was the greatest of philosophers?
    </p>
    <p>
      IX. IS CHRIST OUR EXAMPLE?
    </p>
    <p>
      HE never said a word in favor of education. He never even hinted at the
      existence of any science. He never uttered a word in favor of industry,
      economy or of any effort to better our condition in this world. He was the
      enemy of the successful, of the wealthy. Dives was sent to hell, not
      because he was bad, but because he was rich. Lazarus went to heaven, not
      because he was good, but because he was poor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Christ cared nothing for painting, for sculpture, for music&mdash;nothing
      for any art. He said nothing about the duties of nation to nation, of king
      to subject; nothing about the rights of man; nothing about intellectual
      liberty or the freedom of speech. He said nothing about the sacredness of
      home; not one word for the fireside; not a word in favor of marriage, in
      honor of maternity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He never married. He wandered homeless from place to place with a few
      disciples. None of them seem to have been engaged in any useful business,
      and they seem to have lived on alms. .
    </p>
    <p>
      All human ties were held in contempt; this world was sacrificed for the
      next; all human effort was discouraged. God would support and protect.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, in the dusk of death, Christ, finding that he was mistaken, cried
      out: "My God! My God! Why hast thou forsaken me?"
    </p>
    <p>
      We have found that man must depend on himself. He must clear the land; he
      must build the home; he must plow and plant; he must invent; he must work
      with hand and brain; he must overcome the difficulties and obstructions;
      he must conquer and enslave the forces of nature to the end that they may
      do the work of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      X. WHY SHOULD WE PLACE CHRIST AT THE TOP AND SUMMIT OF THE HUMAN RACE?
    </p>
    <p>
      AS he kinder, more forgiving, more self-sacrificing than Buddha? Was he
      wiser, did he meet death with more perfect calmness, than Socrates? Was he
      more patient, more charitable, than Epictetus? Was he a greater
      philosopher, a deeper thinker, than Epicurus? In what respect was he the
      superior of Zoroaster? Was he gentler than Lao-tsze, more universal than
      Confucius? Were his ideas of human rights and duties superior to those of
      Zeno? Did he express grander truths than Cicero? Was his mind subtler than
      Spinoza's? Was his brain equal to Kepler's or Newton's? Was he grander in
      death&mdash;a sublimer martyr than Bruno? Was he in intelligence, in the
      force and beauty of expression, in breadth and scope of thought, in wealth
      of illustration, in aptness of comparison, in knowledge of the human brain
      and heart, of all passions, hopes and fears, the equal of Shakespeare, the
      greatest of the human race?
    </p>
    <p>
      If Christ was in fact God, he knew all the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Him like a panorama moved the history yet to be. He knew how his
      words would be interpreted. He knew what crimes, what horrors, what
      infamies, would be committed in his name. He knew that the hungry flames
      of persecution would climb around the limbs of countless martyrs. He knew
      that thousands and thousands of brave men and women would languish in
      dungeons in darkness, filled with pain. He knew that his church would
      invent and use instruments of torture; that his followers would appeal to
      whip and fagot, to chain and rack. He saw the horizon of the future lurid
      with the flames of the auto da fe. He knew what creeds would spring like
      poisonous fungi from every text. He saw the ignorant sects waging war
      against each other. He saw thousands of men, under the orders of priests,
      building prisons for their fellow-men. He saw thousands of scaffolds
      dripping with the best and bravest blood. He saw his followers using the
      instruments of pain. He heard the groans&mdash;saw the faces white with
      agony. He heard the shrieks and sobs and cries of all the moaning,
      martyred multitudes. He knew that commentaries would be written on his
      words with swords, to be read by the light of fagots. He knew that the
      Inquisition would be born of the teachings attributed to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw the interpolations and falsehoods that hypocrisy would write and
      tell. He saw all wars that would be waged, and-he knew that above these
      fields of death, these dungeons, these rackings, these burnings, these
      executions, for a thousand years would float the dripping banner of the
      cross.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that hypocrisy would be robed and crowned&mdash;that cruelty and
      credulity would rule the world; knew that liberty would perish from the
      earth; knew that popes and kings in his name would enslave the souls and
      bodies of men; knew that they would persecute and destroy the discoverers,
      thinkers and inventors; knew that his church would extinguish reason's
      holy light and leave the world without a star.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw his disciples extinguishing the eyes of men, flaying them alive,
      cutting out their tongues, searching for all the nerves of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He knew that in his name his followers would trade in human flesh; that
      cradles would be robbed and women's breasts unbabed for gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      And yet he died with voiceless lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did he fail to speak? Why did he not tell his disciples, and through
      them the world: "You shall not burn, imprison and torture in my name. You
      shall not persecute your fellow-men."
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did he not plainly say: "I am the Son of God," or, "I am God"? Why did
      he not explain the Trinity? Why did he not tell the mode of baptism that
      was pleasing to him? Why did he not write a creed? Why did he not break
      the chains of slaves? Why did he not say that the Old Testament was or was
      not the inspired word of God? Why did he not write the New Testament
      himself? Why did he leave his words to ignorance, hypocrisy and chance?
      Why did he not say something positive, definite and satisfactory about
      another world? Why did he not turn the tear-stained hope of heaven into
      the glad knowledge of another life? Why did he not tell us something of
      the rights of man, of the liberty of hand and brain?
    </p>
    <p>
      Why did he go dumbly to his death, leaving the world to misery and to
      doubt?
    </p>
    <p>
      I will tell you why. He was a man, and did not know.
    </p>
    <p>
      XI. INSPIRATION
    </p>
    <p>
      NOT before about the third century was it claimed or believed that the
      books composing the New Testament were inspired.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered that there were a great number of books of Gospels,
      Epistles and Acts, and that from these the "inspired" ones were selected
      by "uninspired" men.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between the "Fathers" there were great differences of opinion as to which
      books were inspired; much discussion and plenty of hatred. Many of the
      books now deemed spurious were by many of the "Fathers" regarded as
      divine, and some now regarded as inspired were believed to be spurious.
      Many of the early Christians and some of the "Fathers" repudiated the
      Gospel of John, the Epistle to the Hebrews, Jude, James, Peter, and the
      Revelation of St. John. On the other hand, many of them regarded the
      Gospel of the Hebrews, of the Egyptians, the Preaching ol Peter, the
      Shepherd of Hermas, the Epistle of Barnabas, the Pastor of Hermas, the
      Revelation of Peter, the Revelation of Paul, the Epistle of Clement, the
      Gospel of Nicodemus, inspired Books, equal to the very best.
    </p>
    <p>
      From all these books, and many others, the Christians selected the
      inspired ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men who did the selecting were ignorant and superstitious. They were
      firm believers in the miraculous. They thought that diseases had been
      cured by the aprons and handkerchiefs of the apostles, by the bones of the
      dead. They believed in the fable of the Phoenix, and that the hyenas
      changed their sex every year.
    </p>
    <p>
      Were the men who through many centuries made the selections inspired? Were
      they&mdash;ignorant, credulous, stupid and malicious&mdash;as well
      qualified to judge of "inspiration" as the students of our time? How are
      we bound by their opinion? Have we not the right to judge for ourselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      Erasmus, one of the leaders of the Reformation, declared that the Epistle
      to the Hebrews was not written by Paul, and he denied the inspiration of
      Second and Third John, and also of Revelation. Luther was of the same
      opinion. He declared James to be an epistle of straw, and denied the
      inspiration of Revelation. Zwinglius rejected the book of Revelation, and
      even Calvin denied that Paul was the author of Hebrews.
    </p>
    <p>
      The truth is that the Protestants did not agree as to what books are
      inspired until 1647, by the Assembly of Westminster.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prove that a book is inspired you must prove the existence of God. You
      must also prove that this God thinks, acts, has objects, ends and aims.
      This Is somewhat difficult.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is impossible to conceive of an infinite being. Having no conception of
      an infinite being, it is impossible to tell whether all the facts we know
      tend to prove or disprove the existence of such a being.
    </p>
    <p>
      God is a guess. If the existence of God is admitted, how are we to prove
      that he inspired the writers of the books of the Bible?
    </p>
    <p>
      How can one man establish the inspiration of another? How can an inspired
      man prove that he is inspired? How can he know himself that he is
      inspired? There is no way to prove the fact of inspiration. The only
      evidence is the word of some man who could by no possibility know anything
      on the Subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      What is inspiration? Did God use men as instruments? Did he cause them to
      write his thoughts? Did he take possession of their minds and destroy
      their wills?
    </p>
    <p>
      Were these writers only partly controlled, so that their mistakes, their
      ignorance and their prejudices were mingled with the wisdom of God?
    </p>
    <p>
      How are we to separate the mistakes of man from the thoughts of God? Can
      we do this without being inspired ourselves? If the original writers were
      inspired, then the translators should have been, and so should be the men
      who tell us what the Bible means.
    </p>
    <p>
      How is it possible for a human being to know that he is inspired by an
      infinite being? But of one thing we may be certain: An inspired book
      should certainly excel all the books produced by uninspired men. It
      should, above all, be true, filled with wisdom, blossoming in beauty&mdash;perfect.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ministers wonder how I can be wicked enough to attack the Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will tell them:
    </p>
    <p>
      This book, the Bible, has persecuted, even unto death, the wisest and the
      best. This book stayed and stopped the onward movement of the human race.
      This book poisoned the fountains of learning and misdirected the energies
      of man.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book is the enemy of freedom, the support of slavery. This book sowed
      the seeds of hatred in families and nations, fed the flames of war, and
      impoverished, the world. This book is the breastwork of kings and tyrants&mdash;the
      enslaver of women and children. This book has corrupted parliaments and
      courts. This book has made colleges and, universities the teachers of
      error and the haters of science. This book has filled Christendom with
      hateful, cruel, ignorant and warring sects. This book taught men to kill
      their fellows for religion's sake. This book founded the Inquisition,
      invented the instruments of torture, built the dungeons in which the good
      and loving languished, forged the chains that rusted in their flesh,
      erected the scaffolds whereon they died. This book piled fagots about the
      feet of the just. This book drove reason from the minds of millions and
      filled the asylums with the insane.
    </p>
    <p>
      This book has caused fathers and mothers to shed the blood of their babes.
      This book was the auction block on which the slave-mother stood when she
      was sold from her child. This book filled the sails of the slave-trader
      and made merchandise of human flesh. This book lighted the fires that,
      burned "witches" and "wizards." This book filled the darkness with ghouls
      and ghosts, and the bodies of men and women with devils. This book
      polluted the souls of men with the infamous dogma of eternal pain. This
      book made credulity the greatest of virtues, and investigation the
      greatest of crimes. This book filled nations with hermits, monks and nuns&mdash;with
      the pious and the useless. This book placed the ignorant and unclean saint
      above the philosopher and philanthropist. This book taught man to despise
      the joys of this life, that he might be happy in another&mdash;to waste
      this world for the sake of the next.
    </p>
    <p>
      I attack this book because it is the enemy of human liberty&mdash;the
      greatest obstruction across the highway of human progress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me ask the ministers one question: How can you be wicked enough to
      defend this book?
    </p>
    <p>
      XII. THE REAL BIBLE.
    </p>
    <p>
      OR thousands of years men have been writing the real Bible, and it is
      being written from day to day, and it will never be finished while man has
      life. All the facts that we know, all the truly recorded events, all the
      discoveries and inventions, all the wonderful machines whose wheels and
      levers seem to think, all the poems, crystals from the brain, flowers from
      the heart, all the songs of love and joy, of smiles and tears, the great
      dramas of Imagination's world, the wondrous paintings, miracles of form
      and color, of light and shade, the marvelous marbles that seem to live and
      breathe, the secrets told by rock and star, by dust and flower, by rain
      and snow, by frost and flame, by winding stream and desert sand, by
      mountain range and billowed sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the wisdom that lengthens and ennobles life&mdash;all that avoids or
      cures disease, or conquers pain&mdash;all just and perfect laws and rules
      that guide and shape our lives, all thoughts that feed the flames of love,
      the music that transfigures, enraptures and enthralls, the victories of
      heart and brain, the miracles that hands have wrought, the deft and
      cunning hands of those who worked for wife and child, the histories of
      noble deeds, of brave and useful men, of faithful loving wives, of
      quenchless mother-love, of conflicts for the right, of sufferings for the
      truth, of all the best that all the men and women of the world have said,
      and thought and done through all the years.
    </p>
    <p>
      These treasures of the heart and brain&mdash;these are the Sacred
      Scriptures of the human race.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
